One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it \"his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir.\" The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Gurlitt's representative said that with the art collector's death, the investigation into the collection ceases. The court that was handling the investigation proceedings will now function as an estate court in the case. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why were pieces of the Gurlitt art collection confiscated by authorities?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Because he took them from the museum</Answer>",

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>For what reason did King Henry VIII start the \"Rough Wooing\"?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The religious schism</Answer>",

Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c. Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters. The Third and final Punic War ended in 149 b.c. , though national solidarity was still a long way off.

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement.

The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators. These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers. The professors expect to make their study available through a Web site, www.eeo1.com. The Blumrosens, who were instrumental in setting up the E.E.O.C. in 1965, also say the government should make more active use of their data.

He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the event of any attacks on U.S. interests, anywhere, by  Bin Laden. He further proposed to Berger that a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan-a proposal not adopted. Warned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the millennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 and decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots. Michael Sheehan, the State Department member of the CSG, communicated warnings to the Taliban that they would be held responsible for future al Qaeda attacks.\" Mike was not diplomatic,\" Clarke reported to Berger. With virtually no evidence of a Taliban response, a new approach was made to Pakistan. 13 General Anthony Zinni, the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM), was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to \"take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time.\" But Zinni came back emptyhanded. As Ambassador William Milam reported from Islamabad, Musharraf was \"unwilling to take the political heat at home.\" The CIA worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye on suspected  Bin Laden associates. Tenet spoke to 20 of his foreign counterparts. Disruption and arrest operations were mounted against terrorists in eight countries. In mid-December, President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification (MON) giving the CIA broader authority to use foreign proxies to detain  Bin Laden lieutenants, without having to transfer them to U.S. custody. The authority was to capture, not kill, though lethal force might be used if necessary.16Tenet would later send a message to all CIA personnel overseas, saying, \"The threat could not be more real. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>When do the events in the whole article take place?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>December 1999</Answer>",

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement.

Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic.

The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was cousin to Elizabeth Tudor?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Ann boleyn</Answer>",

Like ice wedging, abrasion does not change the rock into another type of rock. With abrasion, one rock or piece of sediment bumps against another rock. Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind. It is like sand-blasting a rock. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What forces cause rocks to move?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Sand</Answer>",

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972. At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What is the name of the psychologist who is known as the originator of social learning theory?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>David Starr</Answer>",

In all those years, she never lost a case. When she stepped down, she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty law. \"I realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole generation of public-interest lawyers,\" she said. \"It had gone from being an economic sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic impossibility. ...

He was also the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Finland. Alexander was the most successful Russian reformer since Peter the Great. His most important achievement was the emancipation of serfs in 1861, for which he became known as Alexander the Liberator (Russian: Aleksandr Osvoboditel', tr. Aleksandr Osvoboditel; IPA: [aljI'ksandr asv@ba'djitjIlj]). The tsar was responsible for numerous other reforms including reorganizing the judicial system, setting up elected local judges, abolishing capital punishment, promoting local self-government through the zemstvo system, imposing universal military service, ending some of the privileges of the nobility, and promoting the universities. Despite these reforms, during his reign, his brutal secret police, known as the Third Section, sent thousands of dissidents into exile in Siberia. In foreign policy, Alexander sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, fearing the remote colony would fall into British hands if there was another war. He sought peace, moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871, and in 1872 joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation. Despite his otherwise pacifistic foreign policy, he fought a brief war with Turkey in 1877-78, pursued further expansion into Siberia and the Caucasus, and conquered Turkestan. Although disappointed by the results of the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Alexander abided by that agreement. Among his greatest domestic challenges was an uprising in Poland in 1863, to which he responded by stripping that land of its separate Constitution and incorporating it directly into Russia. Alexander was proposing additional parliamentary reforms to counter the rise of nascent revolutionary and anarchistic movements when he was assassinated in 1881. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many years after the end of the war with Turkey was Alexander II assassinated?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>1878</Answer>",

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement.

In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability.

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret. Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work. The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, as they are today. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Before 9/11, who relied on proxies instead of developing a robust capabilities?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The military</Answer>",

This means that as the Earth rotates, one hemisphere has longer days with shorter nights. At the same time the other hemisphere has shorter days and longer nights.

This is the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. The South Pole is pointed The hemisphere that is tilted away from the Sun is cooler because it receives fewer direct rays. As Earth orbits the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere goes from winter to spring, then summer and fall. The Southern Hemisphere does the opposite from summer to fall to winter to spring. When it is winter in the Northern hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa. What does this mean for you? If you live in North America, July 1 is usually a very warm day. If you traveled to Southern Australia, you would need a heavy coat. At the equator, the seasons never change. As a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.

His liberal sentiments made him distrusted by the government of Charles Felix as a dangerous man, and he was doomed to an inactive life in an unimportant post. He soon quitted the army, and embarked in business operations as manager of one of the estates of his family. For twelve years he confined himself to agricultural labors, making himself acquainted with all the details of business and with the science of agriculture, introducing such improvements as the use of guano, and promoting agricultural associations; but he was not indifferent at the same time to public affairs, being one of the most zealous advocates of constitutional liberty. A residence in England gave him much valuable knowledge as to the working of representative institutions. He established in 1847 a political newspaper, and went into parliament as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. In 1848 he used all his influence to induce the government to make war with Austria; and when Charles Albert abdicated, and Victor Emmanuel became king, Cavour's great talents were rewarded. In 1850 he became minister of commerce; in 1852, prime minister.

The first, entitled A Happy Death (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to The Stranger's Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books.

However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties. In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What product the investigation is centered on?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Narcotics</Answer>",

The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube).

Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities.

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which women appeared in the \"Safety in Paradise\" safety video?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Deborah Russell</Answer>",

Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision.

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>Mary, Queen of Scots: The baby was Mary Stuart, who at the age of nine months was crowned Queen of Scots at the Chapel Royal, Stirling. When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>For what reason did Mary Stuart return to Scotland at age 18?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The reformation was happening</Answer>",

A man and woman sat over it; the man, a tall, repulsive-looking creature, with unkempt hair and matted beard, his age apparently about fifty.  The woman looked seventy or more.  She too had once been tall, but now old age gave her a withered, witch-like appearance, in spite of her great height.  She was dressed in limp, faded garments, with a tattered shawl crossed over her chest, and had a scared, miserable look in her bleared old eyes.  There were a few words of explanation from the man who had come home, and then, in gruff but not unkindly tones, he bade Babette be seated, and told his mother to get some supper speedily.  She spread a coarse cloth on the wooden table, and when all was ready, lifted a large black saucepan from the stove and turned out a smoking, savoury-looking stew.  The youngest son produced a bottle containing the thin acid wine of the country, and another of spirits.  As he set them on the table, Babette noticed that across one of his hands, which were much smaller and whiter than those of his brothers, there ran a dull red scar that looked as if he had had a bad cut there.

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip.

There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root\u2014too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why did a new emphasis on quality and on safeguarding the environment take root in Spain in the late 1990s?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Spain joined the European Community</Answer>",

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs.

There was an angry scene between the two, and Edgar was told that he must leave the university and go into the counting-room. It appears that he made some attempt to tie himself down to figures and accounts and business routine; but as he had not been brought up to this kind of life, he soon tired of it, and decided to go into the world to seek his own fortune. He went to Boston, where he published a volume of poetry. In the preface to this volume, Poe says that the poems were written before he was fourteen. Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were. While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them. This gentleman advised against it on the ground that it would make Edgar conceited,--a fault from which he was already suffering.

There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root\u2014too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which king brought democracy to Spain and was democracy successful?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Alfonso XIII</Answer>",

His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Parmigianino, all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work. His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the \"Little Masters\" who attempted few large engravings but continued Durer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. Lucas van Leyden was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Durer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds (Giulio Campagnola and Christofano Robetta), or whole prints (Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano). However, Durer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also. In painting, Durer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Durer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the Durer Renaissance of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945. Durer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by D'Arcy Thompson in his book On Growth and Form. The Lutheran Church remembers Durer as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Burgkmair. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and Matthias Grunewald on August 5. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who had an intimidating effect on Little Masters for large engravings?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Marcantonio</Answer>",

In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism.

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail. But he's entitled to have a public defender ... Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\" LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients. Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What is the first name of the man who became king of France in 1559, but died soon after?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Henry VIII</Answer>",

Robert Menendez. With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez. While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why did people take materials from the office?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>They were stolen</Answer>",

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret.

Leigh on screenwriting: \"I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process.\" In that time, he has been nominated for five Oscars, as well as winning the Best Director award at Cannes Film Festival for \"Naked\" in 1993, the Palme d'Or there for \"Secrets & Lies\" in 1996 and the Leono d'Oro at Venice Film Festival in 2004 for \"Vera Drake.\" Famous for his fierce independence (read refusal to work in Hollywood), Leigh's work is known for gritty realism and a focus on underprivileged sections of British society. Another of Leigh's calling cards is an unconventional approach to screenwriting. \"The Screening Room\" caught up with the veteran director at the International Screenwriters' Festival in the UK earlier this year to ask him more about his approach to making films. The Screening Room: Why is this festival so important to you?

Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was \"toi kratistoi\"--\"to the strongest\". Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him. Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \"The Successors\" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: Ptolemaic Egypt, Selucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who supported Alexander's half-brother?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>This arrangement</Answer>",

According to Lindsay, FEMA has already received 44,000 inspection requests in Texas. The number of individuals seeking relief from the floods across South Texas increased by more than 1,000 Tuesday, bringing the total to 5,855, he said. FEMA has already distributed $1.8 million in relief in the form of emergency housing. \"The registration process is going rapidly,\" Lindsay said, adding that most registrations took between 5 and 7 minutes. Aid also is available from the local chapter of the Red Cross, but flooding victims must interview with the Red Cross separately to receive aid from them, too. Daletta Andreas, Hill Country chapter executive director, said the chapter has received calls from people who thought registering with FEMA or for cleanup services from local groups automatically registered them for Red Cross services. That's incorrect, Andreas said. \"They need to come in and go through our interview process,\" she said. The Red Cross service center, 333 Earl Garrett St., is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, and will be open this weekend, Andreas said. People seeking assistance must provide identification proving they reside in the area. Members of the State Bar of Texas are offering free legal advice for flood victims. Victims in Texas counties declared a federal disaster can call (800) 504-7030 for assistance with basic legal questions.

In May 1904, the couple's first son, Hans Albert Einstein, was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their second son, Eduard, was born in Zurich in July 1910. In 1914, the couple separated; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called \"Tete\" (for petit), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, including full-time after her death. The marriage with Maric does not seem to have been very happy. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be\" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Elsa Lowenthal on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally. In 1933, they emigrated to the United States.

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret. Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work. The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, as they are today. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What should the United States do instead of concentrating on two entities to carry out secret military operations?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Letting intelligence operations in the hands of the military</Answer>",

The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators. These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers.

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who has the authority to conduct covert operations that, although a small fraction of the Agency's budget, have been controversial and dominated public perception of the CIA</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>DCI</Answer>",

They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said. About 500 employees were also outside the building protesting. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Have any executives from the Caterpillar factory been hurt by the workers so far?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>No</Answer>",

His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Parmigianino, all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work. His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the \"Little Masters\" who attempted few large engravings but continued Durer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. Lucas van Leyden was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Durer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds (Giulio Campagnola and Christofano Robetta), or whole prints (Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano). However, Durer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also. In painting, Durer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Durer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the Durer Renaissance of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945. Durer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by D'Arcy Thompson in his book On Growth and Form. The Lutheran Church remembers Durer as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Burgkmair. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and Matthias Grunewald on August 5. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which organization holds remembrance for Durer in the winter holiday season?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The Durer Renaissance</Answer>",

The opening was low and narrow. A few saplings bound together with strips of rawhide closed it against stray beasts. Bukawai removed the primitive door and pushed Tibo within. The hyenas, snarling, rushed past him and were lost to view in the blackness of the interior. Bukawai replaced the saplings and seizing Tibo roughly by the arm, dragged him along a narrow, rocky passage. The floor was comparatively smooth, for the dirt which lay thick upon it had been trodden and tramped by many feet until few inequalities remained. The passage was tortuous, and as it was very dark and the walls rough and rocky, Tibo was scratched and bruised from the many bumps he received. Bukawai walked as rapidly through the winding gallery as one would traverse a familiar lane by daylight. He knew every twist and turn as a mother knows the face of her child, and he seemed to be in a hurry. He jerked poor little Tibo possibly a trifle more ruthlessly than necessary even at the pace Bukawai set; but the old witch-doctor, an outcast from the society of man, diseased, shunned, hated, feared, was far from possessing an angelic temper. Nature had given him few of the kindlier characteristics of man, and these few Fate had eradicated entirely.

Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision.

Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>The National Security Act of 1947 created what agency and what was its purpose?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>DCI to ignore the intelligence community</Answer>",

The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility, and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway. It has its own parking, something that's hard to find downtown and which has been a problem for staff as well as clients. Owning and sharing the building and not paying rent times five will save the non-profit agencies about $375,000 each year.

In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997.

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video.

The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators. These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers. The professors expect to make their study available through a Web site, www.eeo1.com. The Blumrosens, who were instrumental in setting up the E.E.O.C. in 1965, also say the government should make more active use of their data. The commission said it did not comment on draft reports. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What kind of discrimination was found and was suggestion made to the government?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>There are greater opportunity for minorities, with standard deviation</Answer>",

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005\u20131034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What do we know about the Votadini?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>They were Scottish</Answer>",

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which women appeared in the \"Safety in Paradise\" safety video?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Farrah Fosset</Answer>",

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town\" to enstill the memory of the vengeance of God?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Prince James</Answer>",

A fight ensued , which led to the Sharptooth 's death . However , the sharptooth left `` The Lone Dinosaur '' with a scar slashed across his right eye . Soon after the battle , a huge monolith that resembled a proud sauropod , having life-sized Sharptooth teeth arranged around his neck , came out of the ground during an earthquake . The dinosaurs called it `` Saurus Rock '' . The legend also states that if anyone damages the monolith , bad luck would descend upon the valley . A few days later when the kids are playing , Littlefoot accidentally falls off a cliff . Just before he hits the ground , a gruff Diplodocus rescues him .

The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators. These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers. The professors expect to make their study available through a Web site, www.eeo1.com. The Blumrosens, who were instrumental in setting up the E.E.O.C. in 1965, also say the government should make more active use of their data. The commission said it did not comment on draft reports. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>If a third of the employees were projected to be discriminatory, how many were not discriminatory?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>20,000</Answer>",

On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism. He said that \"one of the nation's most fundamental responsibilities is to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.\" The budget guidance issued the next day, however, highlighted gun crimes, narcotics trafficking, and civil rights as priorities. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Former senator of which state wanted to reform FBI?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>John Ashcroft from Missouri</Answer>",

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.

Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia.

He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the event of any attacks on U.S. interests, anywhere, by  Bin Laden. He further proposed to Berger that a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan-a proposal not adopted. Warned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the millennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 and decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots. Michael Sheehan, the State Department member of the CSG, communicated warnings to the Taliban that they would be held responsible for future al Qaeda attacks.\" Mike was not diplomatic,\" Clarke reported to Berger. With virtually no evidence of a Taliban response, a new approach was made to Pakistan. 13 General Anthony Zinni, the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM), was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to \"take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time.\" But Zinni came back emptyhanded. As Ambassador William Milam reported from Islamabad, Musharraf was \"unwilling to take the political heat at home.\" The CIA worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye on suspected  Bin Laden associates. Tenet spoke to 20 of his foreign counterparts. Disruption and arrest operations were mounted against terrorists in eight countries. In mid-December, President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification (MON) giving the CIA broader authority to use foreign proxies to detain  Bin Laden lieutenants, without having to transfer them to U.S. custody. The authority was to capture, not kill, though lethal force might be used if necessary.16Tenet would later send a message to all CIA personnel overseas, saying, \"The threat could not be more real. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who proposed to strike Al Qaeda in 1999?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>George Tenet</Answer>",

In August 2011, the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot, but Camus's biographer, Olivier Todd, did not consider it credible. Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Lourmarin, Vaucluse, France. He was the second-youngest recipient, at the age of 44, of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after Rudyard Kipling, at the age of 42. He was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine, who hold the copyrights to his work. Two of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first, entitled A Happy Death (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to The Stranger's Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, The First Man (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. The novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>A Milan newspaper thought this person's death was part of a Soviet plot.</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Michel Gallimard</Answer>",

She lived on a $3-a-week stipend that she spent on pantyhose and bus fare. Her law practice grew to an organization that brought in millions of dollars of damages through its cases against L.A. slumlords, allowing poor families to set up college funds and buy homes. In all those years, she never lost a case. When she stepped down, she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty law. \"I realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole generation of public-interest lawyers,\" she said. \"It had gone from being an economic sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic impossibility. ... The whole system has essentially collapsed.\" Mintie also started to ask questions about the medical field. Almost every person who walks into a free medical clinic, she said, faces some legal problem such as an eviction or the loss of Social Security benefits. And many of her clients had medical problems from living in slum housing such as cockroaches lodged in ear canals and rat bite fever, a nonfatal malady that particularly affects children. Mintie noticed that health-care professionals were graduating with staggering debts and also couldn't afford to work with the poor. Her work was noticed by Oprah Winfrey, who invited her on the TV show March 26, 2001. Mintie received a $100,000 \"Use Your Life Award\" from Oprah's Angel Network, a nonprofit organization that awards money to those who help others. Mintie said that all of the money has gone to her recipients -- none was spent on overhead. She will be out of funds by spring. She is trying to get religious organizations to sponsor recipients.

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret. Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work. The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, as they are today. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Before 9/11, who relied on proxies instead of developing a robust capabilities?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>U.S</Answer>",

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail.

Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\" LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients. Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program. One local Springfield attorney volunteered to handle the case.\" </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What county is being discussed in this passage?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Butler</Answer>",

In May 1904, the couple's first son, Hans Albert Einstein, was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their second son, Eduard, was born in Zurich in July 1910. In 1914, the couple separated; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called \"Tete\" (for petit), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, including full-time after her death. The marriage with Maric does not seem to have been very happy. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be\" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Elsa Lowenthal on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally. In 1933, they emigrated to the United States. In 1935, Elsa Einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems; she died in December 1936. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was called \"Tete\" in the story?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Elsa</Answer>",

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972. At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What influential experiment, conducted in 1961, is the fourth most often cited psychologist responsible for?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The Bobo Doll</Answer>",

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>The city of Edinburgh grew up around the steep, ragged cliff of the Castle Rock and its easily defended summit. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005\u20131034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What languages were spoken in old time Scotland that are listed in the article?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Angels</Answer>",

Then fall from the trees to the ground. As the leaves are falling, they have kinetic energy. While they are still attached to the trees they also have energy. When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy? Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy. This stored energy is called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position. For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall. They fall because of the pull of gravity. Potential energy can be transferred into motion. Motion can also be turned back into potential energy. Objects have potential energy due to their position. A leaf on a tree branch has potential energy. The leafs energy can be turned into motion as it falls.

The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators. These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers. The professors expect to make their study available through a Web site, www.eeo1.com.

Vancouver to join the command under General Wheaton. As soon as the settlers could fort up for mutual protection, the entire forces of regulars and volunteers were concentrated at Van Bremer's ranch west of the lava beds under General Wheaton and at Land's ranch on the east side of Tule Lake and directly north of the stronghold. Such was the disposition of the forces when I arrived at headquarters at Van Bremer's ranch. By orders of Governor Grover of Oregon the volunteers under Captains O. C. Applegate and Kelley were placed under the command of General Wheaton. The two companies numbered about 225 men, and were commanded by General John E. Ross, a veteran Indian fighter, but too old to withstand the hardships of a winter campaign against Indians. The men were all poorly provided with clothing and bedding, most all having taken only what they could strap behind their saddles, but in spite of this and a temperature often below zero, no murmur was heard, and all anxiously, eagerly looked forward to a meeting with the brutal savage murderers of their fellow citizens.

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

Then he made a speech. The speech was about public-spirited citizens who, to the neglect of their own interests, came to assist the ends of justice, and fellow-creatures in misfortune. He purposely spoke in a loud voice, and every one stopped to listen. \"The law, Mr. Thorndike, is not vindictive,\" he said. \"It wishes only to be just.

Fact: If, before all the air is sucked out of the ship, a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into a space suit, that person has less than twenty-four hours to live. This is more than the person would have sans space suit. Me, I found a space suit, but it was statistically unlikely that I, and whomever else has followed suit (pun intended), would manage to repair our ship before the less-than-twenty-four hours are up; yes, studies have been done.

The new Community Legal Center at 205 N. 400 West is a project of \"And Justice for All,\" which, until this venture, has been a joint fund-raising campaign by an alliance of the non-profit providers of free legal services. \"And Justice for All,\" which solicits donations primarily from Utah lawyers and foundations, was the first joint fund-raising campaign of legal services agencies in the country, and the Community Legal Center is the first joint office project of public service law groups. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility, and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway. It has its own parking, something that's hard to find downtown and which has been a problem for staff as well as clients. Owning and sharing the building and not paying rent times five will save the non-profit agencies about $375,000 each year. My assistant, Charity Christenson, pointed out that the shared facility will also be efficient for those needing legal services. No longer will a woman desperate for a protective order, for example, have to run all over town trying to find the right agency. After the tour, we found Jaye Olafson at the cookies and brownies reception on the first floor. Jaye and her husband, Erik, own Tomax Technologies and were the sellers of the building. Jaye explained how much of the renovation had been merely uncovering what was already there. The hardwood floors, wooden ceilings and brick and stone interior walls were all hidden behind coverings and old paint. She loves the building, and they only moved out because the business had outgrown the space. So they renovated the old Sweet Candy Company building for Tomax. The Olafsons are delighted with the new owners. The building had been like home, she explained, and so it was important who would be living there. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>In addition to parking, how else will the new building help the non-profit agencies?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Reduced rent by sharing</Answer>",

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How might Air New Zealand's video partner benefited from helping to make this video?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise</Answer>",

The new Community Legal Center at 205 N. 400 West is a project of \"And Justice for All,\" which, until this venture, has been a joint fund-raising campaign by an alliance of the non-profit providers of free legal services. \"And Justice for All,\" which solicits donations primarily from Utah lawyers and foundations, was the first joint fund-raising campaign of legal services agencies in the country, and the Community Legal Center is the first joint office project of public service law groups. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility, and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway. It has its own parking, something that's hard to find downtown and which has been a problem for staff as well as clients. Owning and sharing the building and not paying rent times five will save the non-profit agencies about $375,000 each year. My assistant, Charity Christenson, pointed out that the shared facility will also be efficient for those needing legal services. No longer will a woman desperate for a protective order, for example, have to run all over town trying to find the right agency. After the tour, we found Jaye Olafson at the cookies and brownies reception on the first floor. Jaye and her husband, Erik, own Tomax Technologies and were the sellers of the building. Jaye explained how much of the renovation had been merely uncovering what was already there. The hardwood floors, wooden ceilings and brick and stone interior walls were all hidden behind coverings and old paint. She loves the building, and they only moved out because the business had outgrown the space. So they renovated the old Sweet Candy Company building for Tomax. The Olafsons are delighted with the new owners. The building had been like home, she explained, and so it was important who would be living there. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What five groups work under the \"And Justice For All\" project?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services</Answer>",

Great, gloomy caverns of places, unlit by any ray of daylight.  Yet, I would not shirk the work.  I felt that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Besides Elizabeth, who else did Mary Stuart clash with?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Henry v</Answer>",

There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root\u2014too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which king brought democracy to Spain and was democracy successful?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Franco brought successful democracy to Spain</Answer>",

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000.

The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What made England become a Protestant country?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control</Answer>",

He was also the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Finland. Alexander was the most successful Russian reformer since Peter the Great. His most important achievement was the emancipation of serfs in 1861, for which he became known as Alexander the Liberator (Russian: Aleksandr Osvoboditel', tr. Aleksandr Osvoboditel; IPA: [aljI'ksandr asv@ba'djitjIlj]). The tsar was responsible for numerous other reforms including reorganizing the judicial system, setting up elected local judges, abolishing capital punishment, promoting local self-government through the zemstvo system, imposing universal military service, ending some of the privileges of the nobility, and promoting the universities. Despite these reforms, during his reign, his brutal secret police, known as the Third Section, sent thousands of dissidents into exile in Siberia. In foreign policy, Alexander sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, fearing the remote colony would fall into British hands if there was another war. He sought peace, moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871, and in 1872 joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation. Despite his otherwise pacifistic foreign policy, he fought a brief war with Turkey in 1877-78, pursued further expansion into Siberia and the Caucasus, and conquered Turkestan. Although disappointed by the results of the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Alexander abided by that agreement. Among his greatest domestic challenges was an uprising in Poland in 1863, to which he responded by stripping that land of its separate Constitution and incorporating it directly into Russia. Alexander was proposing additional parliamentary reforms to counter the rise of nascent revolutionary and anarchistic movements when he was assassinated in 1881. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What titles did Alexander II hold?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Emperor Of Russia, King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Finland</Answer>",

Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind.

Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently.

This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.

The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

Leigh on screenwriting: \"I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process.\" In that time, he has been nominated for five Oscars, as well as winning the Best Director award at Cannes Film Festival for \"Naked\" in 1993, the Palme d'Or there for \"Secrets & Lies\" in 1996 and the Leono d'Oro at Venice Film Festival in 2004 for \"Vera Drake.\" Famous for his fierce independence (read refusal to work in Hollywood), Leigh's work is known for gritty realism and a focus on underprivileged sections of British society. Another of Leigh's calling cards is an unconventional approach to screenwriting. \"The Screening Room\" caught up with the veteran director at the International Screenwriters' Festival in the UK earlier this year to ask him more about his approach to making films. The Screening Room: Why is this festival so important to you? Mike Leigh: I am a filmmaker who is both a writer and director and I have this way of making films where the writing and the actors and the shooting is all combined together. I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process. TSR: What do you think other scriptwriters can learn from you? ML: I think screenwriters who, because of the politics and economics of the film industry, are forced to work in a much more conventional way, are always fascinated to discuss with me how I work. TSR: There is this romantic idea that screenwriting has to be a painful, solitary experience. That's not what you experience, though. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Was Mike Leigh an Academy Award-nominated screenwriter?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Yes, he was nominated five times</Answer>",

But Smith, like many volunteers, doesn't want any accolades. \"I'm no saint,\" the 80-year-old Tallahasseean said. \"I'm just a country lawyer.\" His assistant, attorney Twyla Sketchley, sat behind his shoulder and silently mouthed, \"He is a saint.\" Every month, Smith visits the Smith Williams Center in the Bond community and the Wakulla County Senior Citizens Council building in Crawfordville to advise seniors on wills, power of attorney and other legal matters. Smith practiced law for a living until 1982. Since then, he's been semi-retired, devoting himself to helping fellow seniors who are needy. \"I'm getting unable to do much physically, but my brain hasn't quit,\" said Smith, who walks with a cane. \"And I'd rather people ask a foolish question now than have them make a dumb mistake later.\" Smith and Sketchley helped Beatrice Jackson at the Smith Williams Center on Wednesday. Jackson, who said she was \"over 60,\" needed help with estate planning. \"He's not through with me yet ... but he's done a real good job,\" said Jackson, a retired state worker. Over the years, Smith said, he's helped clients with not only wills but also adoptions, divorces and even animal control cases. \"Someone's cat was bit by a dog, as I recall,\" he said. Smith coordinates his volunteer lawyering through Legal Services of North Florida, a nonprofit organization serving low-income families and individuals. \"He's such a fine, fine person,\" said executive director Kris Knab. Without him, \"There would be a huge (number) of people who would go without assistance. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Do people say positive things about Smith?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>No</Answer>",

New trees can be planted to replace those that are cut down. Sunlight is a renewable resource. It seems we will never run out of that! Just because a resource is renewable, it doesnt mean we should use it carelessly. If we  aren't careful, we can pollute resources. Then they may no longer be fit for use. Water is one example. If we pollute a water source it may not be usable for drinking, bathing, or any other type of use. We can also overuse resources that should be renewable. In this case, the resources may not be able to recover. For example, fish are renewable resources. Thats because they can reproduce and make more fish. But water pollution and overfishing can cause them to die out if their population becomes too low.

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail. But he's entitled to have a public defender ... Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\" LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients. Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005\u20131034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The Picts</Answer>",

Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland.

In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism.

He was moving out of the railed enclosure when Andrews called him by name. \"His honor,\" he said impressively, \"wishes to speak to you.\" The judge leaned over his desk and shook Mr. Thorndike by the hand. Then he made a speech. The speech was about public-spirited citizens who, to the neglect of their own interests, came to assist the ends of justice, and fellow-creatures in misfortune. He purposely spoke in a loud voice, and every one stopped to listen. \"The law, Mr. Thorndike, is not vindictive,\" he said. \"It wishes only to be just.

Caterpillar's French staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs. It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations. Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said.

The opening was low and narrow. A few saplings bound together with strips of rawhide closed it against stray beasts. Bukawai removed the primitive door and pushed Tibo within. The hyenas, snarling, rushed past him and were lost to view in the blackness of the interior. Bukawai replaced the saplings and seizing Tibo roughly by the arm, dragged him along a narrow, rocky passage. The floor was comparatively smooth, for the dirt which lay thick upon it had been trodden and tramped by many feet until few inequalities remained. The passage was tortuous, and as it was very dark and the walls rough and rocky, Tibo was scratched and bruised from the many bumps he received. Bukawai walked as rapidly through the winding gallery as one would traverse a familiar lane by daylight. He knew every twist and turn as a mother knows the face of her child, and he seemed to be in a hurry. He jerked poor little Tibo possibly a trifle more ruthlessly than necessary even at the pace Bukawai set; but the old witch-doctor, an outcast from the society of man, diseased, shunned, hated, feared, was far from possessing an angelic temper.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What did Henry VIII hear that made him think he had a chance to subdue Scotland?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The baby was Mary Stuart, who at the age of nine months was crowned Queen of Scots at the Chapel Royal, Stirling.

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail. But he's entitled to have a public defender ... Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\" LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients. Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from Amphipolis, he traveled east into the country of the \"Independent Thracians\"; and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.

The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.

The collapse happened around 4 p.m., one hour before spectators were set to begin streaming in for a concert by the alternative rock group Radiohead. Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. \"Unfortunately, four people were hurt,\" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. \"The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area.\" Firefighters arrived to find one man \"trapped under the structure,\" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance. They helped to extricate the man, then moved away from what was then still considered an \"unstable structure,\" Bellavance added. Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, \"immediately rendered aid,\" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said.

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many male models were featured in the current video</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>12</Answer>",

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs.

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail. But he's entitled to have a public defender ... Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\" LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients. Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c. Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters.

Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace.

Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind.

The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said.

Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew.

One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it \"his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir.\" The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Gurlitt's representative said that with the art collector's death, the investigation into the collection ceases. The court that was handling the investigation proceedings will now function as an estate court in the case. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why were pieces of the Gurlitt art collection confiscated by authorities?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>It was suspected to contain works that were looted by the Nazis</Answer>",

Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c. Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters. The Third and final Punic War ended in 149 b.c. , though national solidarity was still a long way off.

The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN.

He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\" By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years. Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections. And in this network,  Bin Laden's agenda stood out. While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya,  Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the \"far enemy\"-the United States. After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction. In December, bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U.S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, killing two, but no Americans. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question> Bin Laden delivered diatribes in what two locations?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Somalia</Answer>",

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What created the official title for the head of the U.S.intelligence community?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The National Security Act of 1947</Answer>",

When it is winter in the Northern hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa. What does this mean for you? If you live in North America, July 1 is usually a very warm day. If you traveled to Southern Australia, you would need a heavy coat. At the equator, the seasons never change. As a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same. There is no summer and winter as we know them. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What happens at the equator?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>the equator is in the same season all year long</Answer>",

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was cousin to Elizabeth Tudor?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Mary, Queen of Scots</Answer>",

However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties. In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What did Mata purchase for drug traffickers using his badge, even though the murder plot did not move forward?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Drugs</Answer>",

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>When the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the pieds-noirs such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'. Although favouring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pieds-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. From 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for L'Express. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\". When he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals. Camus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyesvsky's Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris. It was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force: 33 actors, 4 hours long, 7 sets, 24 scenes. The walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations. Camus put the painter and set decorator Mayo, who had already illustrated several of Camus' novels (The Stranger - 1948 Ed.), in charge of the demanding task of designing these multiple and complex theater sets. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many scenes are portrayed in Dostoyesvsky's Demons?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>4</Answer>",

While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them.

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What did Mata purchase for drug traffickers using his badge, even though the murder plot did not move forward?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Payment</Answer>",

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Is it true that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>No, this is not true</Answer>",

The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew.

Eduard, whom his father called \"Tete\" (for petit), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Where was the \"Safety in Paradise\" video shot?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The Cook Islands</Answer>",

Thats why his law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation. Universal gravitation means that all objects are affected by gravity in the same way. This is the reason the apple falling from the tree and the Moon being held in orbit is the same. Universal gravitation also means that while Earth exerts a pull on you, you exert a pull on Earth. In fact, there is gravity between you and every mass around you. Even tiny molecules of gas are attracted to one another by the force of gravity. Newtons law had a huge impact on how people thought about the universe.

As soon as the settlers could fort up for mutual protection, the entire forces of regulars and volunteers were concentrated at Van Bremer's ranch west of the lava beds under General Wheaton and at Land's ranch on the east side of Tule Lake and directly north of the stronghold.

In 1914, the couple separated; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called \"Tete\" (for petit), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, including full-time after her death. The marriage with Maric does not seem to have been very happy. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be\" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Elsa Lowenthal on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912.

Then fall from the trees to the ground. As the leaves are falling, they have kinetic energy. While they are still attached to the trees they also have energy. When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy? Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy. This stored energy is called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position. For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall. They fall because of the pull of gravity. Potential energy can be transferred into motion. Motion can also be turned back into potential energy. Objects have potential energy due to their position. A leaf on a tree branch has potential energy. The leafs energy can be turned into motion as it falls.

The collapse happened around 4 p.m., one hour before spectators were set to begin streaming in for a concert by the alternative rock group Radiohead. Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. \"Unfortunately, four people were hurt,\" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. \"The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area.\" Firefighters arrived to find one man \"trapped under the structure,\" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance. They helped to extricate the man, then moved away from what was then still considered an \"unstable structure,\" Bellavance added. Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, \"immediately rendered aid,\" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said.

Threatened with extinction, LSEO clawed its way back with the help of state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way. Meanwhile, the clients keep coming. At least three-quarters are women and children living in poverty. The agency helps more than 12,000 children a year. A third of LSEO's clients are the working poor who receive no government benefits.

In his honor, The Oxley Foundation donated $200,000 to expand a client hot line. That service, which will be expanded statewide, enables needy people to consult an attorney about civil legal problems, including rent and contract disputes, domestic abuse, consumer issues and custody matters. Attorneys handle no criminal cases. R.H. Harbaugh, foundation trustee and a colleague of Athens at the Conner & Winters law firm, said his mentor had \"a special interest in people who could not afford legal services.

Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace.

Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision.

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.

Was the water shallow or deep? Fossils can even provide clues to ancient climates. They can tell us if it was warm or cold. Maybe it was cold or hot? Some places that are now cold were once warm. Some places that are now hot and dry were once wet and cool. Fossils provide a window into the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What information do fossils provide in regards to evolution?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Whether it was land or marine</Answer>",

The collapse happened around 4 p.m., one hour before spectators were set to begin streaming in for a concert by the alternative rock group Radiohead. Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. \"Unfortunately, four people were hurt,\" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. \"The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area.\" Firefighters arrived to find one man \"trapped under the structure,\" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance. They helped to extricate the man, then moved away from what was then still considered an \"unstable structure,\" Bellavance added. Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, \"immediately rendered aid,\" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said. At the time it came down, the weather was good with no storm rolling through or significant winds, added fellow police Constable Harrison Ford. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Approximately what time did the metalwork crash onto the stage in Toronto killing one man on Saturday?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>About 4 pm</Answer>",

When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy? Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy. This stored energy is called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position. For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall. They fall because of the pull of gravity. Potential energy can be transferred into motion. Motion can also be turned back into potential energy. Objects have potential energy due to their position. A leaf on a tree branch has potential energy. The leafs energy can be turned into motion as it falls.

Like ice wedging, abrasion does not change the rock into another type of rock. With abrasion, one rock or piece of sediment bumps against another rock. Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind.

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret. Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work. The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, as they are today. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Before 9/11, who relied on proxies instead of developing a robust capabilities?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>CIA Operative</Answer>",

However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son.

Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it \"his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir.\" The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven.

The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility, and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway. It has its own parking, something that's hard to find downtown and which has been a problem for staff as well as clients. Owning and sharing the building and not paying rent times five will save the non-profit agencies about $375,000 each year. My assistant, Charity Christenson, pointed out that the shared facility will also be efficient for those needing legal services. No longer will a woman desperate for a protective order, for example, have to run all over town trying to find the right agency. After the tour, we found Jaye Olafson at the cookies and brownies reception on the first floor. Jaye and her husband, Erik, own Tomax Technologies and were the sellers of the building. Jaye explained how much of the renovation had been merely uncovering what was already there. The hardwood floors, wooden ceilings and brick and stone interior walls were all hidden behind coverings and old paint. She loves the building, and they only moved out because the business had outgrown the space. So they renovated the old Sweet Candy Company building for Tomax.

His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Parmigianino, all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work. His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the \"Little Masters\" who attempted few large engravings but continued Durer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. Lucas van Leyden was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Durer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds (Giulio Campagnola and Christofano Robetta), or whole prints (Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano). However, Durer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also. In painting, Durer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Durer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the Durer Renaissance of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945. Durer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by D'Arcy Thompson in his book On Growth and Form. The Lutheran Church remembers Durer as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Burgkmair. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and Matthias Grunewald on August 5. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was not intimidated by Durer in producing large engravings?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>D'Arcy Thompson</Answer>",

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005\u20131034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Where is the city of Edinburgh located?

The hyenas, snarling, rushed past him and were lost to view in the blackness of the interior. Bukawai replaced the saplings and seizing Tibo roughly by the arm, dragged him along a narrow, rocky passage. The floor was comparatively smooth, for the dirt which lay thick upon it had been trodden and tramped by many feet until few inequalities remained. The passage was tortuous, and as it was very dark and the walls rough and rocky, Tibo was scratched and bruised from the many bumps he received.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What is the first name of the man who became king of France in 1559, but died soon after?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois II</Answer>",

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs.

Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. \"Unfortunately, four people were hurt,\" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. \"The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area.\" Firefighters arrived to find one man \"trapped under the structure,\" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance. They helped to extricate the man, then moved away from what was then still considered an \"unstable structure,\" Bellavance added. Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, \"immediately rendered aid,\" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said.

Christian activists stage a peace march in Mumbai, India earlier this month. Krishan Kumar, Kandhamal's top administrative official, told CNN the Hindu man was hacked to death at Raikia. Orissa state, which is dominated by tribal people, borders the Bay of Bengal in east-central India, and Kandhamal is located in the center of the state, which has been racked by Hindu-Christian violence. Praveen Kumar, Kandhamal's superintendent of police, said an investigation is under way in both incidents, and did not say whether any suspects were being sought. Twenty-three civilians, excluding police, have died in the Hindu-Christian violence in Kandhamal this month, according to the administrator. \"Arrests are continuing,\" Praveen Kumar said when asked how many people have been held so far in connection with the violence. The latest attacks occurred on a day when India's federal government called upon the state administration to take \"effective, focused and firm measures\" to control the conflicts. On Thursday, federal Home Secretary Madhukar Gupta asked the Orissa government to ensure effective deployment of paramilitaries in the state. -- CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>In which Indian state is Raikia located?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Bengal State</Answer>",

Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was \"toi kratistoi\"--\"to the strongest\". Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him. Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \"The Successors\" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: Ptolemaic Egypt, Selucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who supported Alexander's half-brother?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Philip Arrhidaeus</Answer>",

There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root\u2014too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why was there not very high tourism in Spain during Franco's regime and what happened that allow tourism to increase</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Franco isolated Spain from the rest of Europe</Answer>",

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What animal was Kim Jong Un's uncle rumored to have been feed to?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Tigers</Answer>",

Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c. Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters.

The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities.

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>(CNN) -- German art collector Cornelius Gurlitt, whose nearly priceless collection was confiscated because it was suspected to contain pieces looted by the Nazis, died Tuesday and left the masterpieces to a Swiss museum. One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it \"his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir.\" The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Gurlitt's representative said that with the art collector's death, the investigation into the collection ceases. The court that was handling the investigation proceedings will now function as an estate court in the case. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Will the investigations into the art collection continue after the death of Cornelius Gurlitt?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>With Gurlitt's death, the investigation into the collection ceases</Answer>",

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail. But he's entitled to have a public defender ... Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\" LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients. Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

The collapse happened around 4 p.m., one hour before spectators were set to begin streaming in for a concert by the alternative rock group Radiohead. Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. \"Unfortunately, four people were hurt,\" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. \"The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area.\" Firefighters arrived to find one man \"trapped under the structure,\" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance. They helped to extricate the man, then moved away from what was then still considered an \"unstable structure,\" Bellavance added. Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, \"immediately rendered aid,\" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said.

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many trips has Dennis Rodman made to North Korea in under 12 months?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>3</Answer>",

He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the event of any attacks on U.S. interests, anywhere, by  Bin Laden. He further proposed to Berger that a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan-a proposal not adopted. Warned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the millennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 and decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots. Michael Sheehan, the State Department member of the CSG, communicated warnings to the Taliban that they would be held responsible for future al Qaeda attacks.\" Mike was not diplomatic,\" Clarke reported to Berger. With virtually no evidence of a Taliban response, a new approach was made to Pakistan. 13 General Anthony Zinni, the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM), was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to \"take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time.\" But Zinni came back emptyhanded. As Ambassador William Milam reported from Islamabad, Musharraf was \"unwilling to take the political heat at home.\" The CIA worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye on suspected  Bin Laden associates. Tenet spoke to 20 of his foreign counterparts. Disruption and arrest operations were mounted against terrorists in eight countries. In mid-December, President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification (MON) giving the CIA broader authority to use foreign proxies to detain  Bin Laden lieutenants, without having to transfer them to U.S. custody.

Robert Menendez. With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez. While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Doctor Melgen's office was raided as a result of which publication's article and the resulting investigation?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>New York Times</Answer>",

Any time an object changes motion, a force has been applied. In what ways can this happen? Force can cause an object at rest to start moving. Forces can cause objects to speed up or slow down. Forces can cause a moving object to stop. Forces can also cause a change in direction. In short, forces cause changes in motion. The moving object may change its speed, its direction, or both. We know that changes in motion require a force. We know that the size of the force determines the change in motion. How much an objects motion changes when a force is applied depends on two things. It depends on the strength of the force. It also depends on the objects mass. Think about some simple tasks you may regularly do. You may pick up a baseball.

The general tone of the players is far higher than it was and there has come into evidence a marked improvement in the spirit of the men who own Base Ball clubs.  In the earlier history of the sport there was a tendency to win by any means that did not actually cross the line of dishonesty.

He soon quitted the army, and embarked in business operations as manager of one of the estates of his family. For twelve years he confined himself to agricultural labors, making himself acquainted with all the details of business and with the science of agriculture, introducing such improvements as the use of guano, and promoting agricultural associations; but he was not indifferent at the same time to public affairs, being one of the most zealous advocates of constitutional liberty. A residence in England gave him much valuable knowledge as to the working of representative institutions. He established in 1847 a political newspaper, and went into parliament as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. In 1848 he used all his influence to induce the government to make war with Austria; and when Charles Albert abdicated, and Victor Emmanuel became king, Cavour's great talents were rewarded.

It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations. Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said.

Eduard, whom his father called \"Tete\" (for petit), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, including full-time after her death. The marriage with Maric does not seem to have been very happy. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be\" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Elsa Lowenthal on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912.

In all those years, she never lost a case. When she stepped down, she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty law. \"I realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole generation of public-interest lawyers,\" she said. \"It had gone from being an economic sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic impossibility. ...

Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005\u20131034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was Kenneth MacAlpin's great-great-great Grandson?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Malcolm II</Answer>",

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement.

The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972. At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>In what year was Bandura awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology.</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>2002</Answer>",

The new Community Legal Center at 205 N. 400 West is a project of \"And Justice for All,\" which, until this venture, has been a joint fund-raising campaign by an alliance of the non-profit providers of free legal services. \"And Justice for All,\" which solicits donations primarily from Utah lawyers and foundations, was the first joint fund-raising campaign of legal services agencies in the country, and the Community Legal Center is the first joint office project of public service law groups. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility, and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway. It has its own parking, something that's hard to find downtown and which has been a problem for staff as well as clients. Owning and sharing the building and not paying rent times five will save the non-profit agencies about $375,000 each year. My assistant, Charity Christenson, pointed out that the shared facility will also be efficient for those needing legal services. No longer will a woman desperate for a protective order, for example, have to run all over town trying to find the right agency. After the tour, we found Jaye Olafson at the cookies and brownies reception on the first floor. Jaye and her husband, Erik, own Tomax Technologies and were the sellers of the building. Jaye explained how much of the renovation had been merely uncovering what was already there. The hardwood floors, wooden ceilings and brick and stone interior walls were all hidden behind coverings and old paint. She loves the building, and they only moved out because the business had outgrown the space. So they renovated the old Sweet Candy Company building for Tomax. The Olafsons are delighted with the new owners. The building had been like home, she explained, and so it was important who would be living there. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What five groups work under the \"And Justice For All\" project?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Utah Lawyers Society, Center of Disability, Legal administrations of Utah, Poverty Volunteer Project, and Utah Legal Assistance Program</Answer>",

Leigh on screenwriting: \"I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process.\" In that time, he has been nominated for five Oscars, as well as winning the Best Director award at Cannes Film Festival for \"Naked\" in 1993, the Palme d'Or there for \"Secrets & Lies\" in 1996 and the Leono d'Oro at Venice Film Festival in 2004 for \"Vera Drake.\" Famous for his fierce independence (read refusal to work in Hollywood), Leigh's work is known for gritty realism and a focus on underprivileged sections of British society. Another of Leigh's calling cards is an unconventional approach to screenwriting. \"The Screening Room\" caught up with the veteran director at the International Screenwriters' Festival in the UK earlier this year to ask him more about his approach to making films. The Screening Room: Why is this festival so important to you? Mike Leigh: I am a filmmaker who is both a writer and director and I have this way of making films where the writing and the actors and the shooting is all combined together. I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process. TSR: What do you think other scriptwriters can learn from you? ML: I think screenwriters who, because of the politics and economics of the film industry, are forced to work in a much more conventional way, are always fascinated to discuss with me how I work. TSR: There is this romantic idea that screenwriting has to be a painful, solitary experience. That's not what you experience, though. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Was Mike Leigh an Academy Award-nominated screenwriter?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>No</Answer>",

Everything appeared to be in order, and I was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when the thought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the cellars.  I had not, if I remember rightly, been into them since my hasty search on the evening of the attack.  For, perhaps, the half of a minute, I hesitated.  I would have been very willing to forego the task--as, indeed, I am inclined to think any man well might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, the cellars are the hugest and weirdest.  Great, gloomy caverns of places, unlit by any ray of daylight.  Yet, I would not shirk the work.  I felt that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice.

He was moving out of the railed enclosure when Andrews called him by name. \"His honor,\" he said impressively, \"wishes to speak to you.\" The judge leaned over his desk and shook Mr. Thorndike by the hand. Then he made a speech. The speech was about public-spirited citizens who, to the neglect of their own interests, came to assist the ends of justice, and fellow-creatures in misfortune. He purposely spoke in a loud voice, and every one stopped to listen. \"The law, Mr. Thorndike, is not vindictive,\" he said. \"It wishes only to be just.

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace.

Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c. Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters.

The collapse happened around 4 p.m., one hour before spectators were set to begin streaming in for a concert by the alternative rock group Radiohead. Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. \"Unfortunately, four people were hurt,\" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. \"The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area.\" Firefighters arrived to find one man \"trapped under the structure,\" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance. They helped to extricate the man, then moved away from what was then still considered an \"unstable structure,\" Bellavance added. Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, \"immediately rendered aid,\" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said.

On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism. He said that \"one of the nation's most fundamental responsibilities is to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.\" The budget guidance issued the next day, however, highlighted gun crimes, narcotics trafficking, and civil rights as priorities. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How did Ashcroft want to reform FBI?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>He focused on investigative basics regardless of what he stated on his May 9 congressional hearing about counter-terrorism</Answer>",

This is the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.

Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization.

But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail.

Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>Albert Bandura OC (/baen'dU@r@/; born December 4, 1925) is a psychologist who is the David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science in Psychology at Stanford University. For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972. At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who is the originator of social learning theory?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Albert einstein</Answer>",

Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia. They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western-oriented population during the Crimean War and during the Polish uprising. Encouraging Finnish nationalism and language can also be seen as an attempt to dilute ties with Sweden. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What are the reforms seen as?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia</Answer>",

She lived on a $3-a-week stipend that she spent on pantyhose and bus fare. Her law practice grew to an organization that brought in millions of dollars of damages through its cases against L.A. slumlords, allowing poor families to set up college funds and buy homes. In all those years, she never lost a case. When she stepped down, she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty law. \"I realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole generation of public-interest lawyers,\" she said. \"It had gone from being an economic sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic impossibility. ... The whole system has essentially collapsed.\" Mintie also started to ask questions about the medical field. Almost every person who walks into a free medical clinic, she said, faces some legal problem such as an eviction or the loss of Social Security benefits. And many of her clients had medical problems from living in slum housing such as cockroaches lodged in ear canals and rat bite fever, a nonfatal malady that particularly affects children. Mintie noticed that health-care professionals were graduating with staggering debts and also couldn't afford to work with the poor. Her work was noticed by Oprah Winfrey, who invited her on the TV show March 26, 2001. Mintie received a $100,000 \"Use Your Life Award\" from Oprah's Angel Network, a nonprofit organization that awards money to those who help others. Mintie said that all of the money has gone to her recipients -- none was spent on overhead. She will be out of funds by spring. She is trying to get religious organizations to sponsor recipients.

On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism. He said that \"one of the nation's most fundamental responsibilities is to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.\" The budget guidance issued the next day, however, highlighted gun crimes, narcotics trafficking, and civil rights as priorities. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who are John Ashcroft and Dale Watson</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>John Ashcroft is FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism and Dale Watson is the Attorney General</Answer>",

One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it \"his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir.\" The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Gurlitt's representative said that with the art collector's death, the investigation into the collection ceases. The court that was handling the investigation proceedings will now function as an estate court in the case. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Was the Gurlitt art collection returned after confiscation?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Yes, as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry</Answer>",

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Where has Dennis Rodman gone 4 times in one year?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>North Korea</Answer>",

However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son.

Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

But Smith, like many volunteers, doesn't want any accolades. \"I'm no saint,\" the 80-year-old Tallahasseean said. \"I'm just a country lawyer.\" His assistant, attorney Twyla Sketchley, sat behind his shoulder and silently mouthed, \"He is a saint.\" Every month, Smith visits the Smith Williams Center in the Bond community and the Wakulla County Senior Citizens Council building in Crawfordville to advise seniors on wills, power of attorney and other legal matters. Smith practiced law for a living until 1982. Since then, he's been semi-retired, devoting himself to helping fellow seniors who are needy. \"I'm getting unable to do much physically, but my brain hasn't quit,\" said Smith, who walks with a cane. \"And I'd rather people ask a foolish question now than have them make a dumb mistake later.\" Smith and Sketchley helped Beatrice Jackson at the Smith Williams Center on Wednesday. Jackson, who said she was \"over 60,\" needed help with estate planning. \"He's not through with me yet ... but he's done a real good job,\" said Jackson, a retired state worker. Over the years, Smith said, he's helped clients with not only wills but also adoptions, divorces and even animal control cases. \"Someone's cat was bit by a dog, as I recall,\" he said. Smith coordinates his volunteer lawyering through Legal Services of North Florida, a nonprofit organization serving low-income families and individuals. \"He's such a fine, fine person,\" said executive director Kris Knab.

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement. Callisthenes had fallen out of favor by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many plots against Alexander's life were revealed?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Two that we know of</Answer>",

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>The National Security Act of 1947 created what agency and what was its purpose?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>To oversee other agencies</Answer>",

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who is the passive player in Rodman's tragicomedy as North Korea gives him an avenue for his antics?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Kim Jung Un</Answer>",

Then fall from the trees to the ground. As the leaves are falling, they have kinetic energy. While they are still attached to the trees they also have energy. When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy? Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy. This stored energy is called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position. For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall. They fall because of the pull of gravity. Potential energy can be transferred into motion. Motion can also be turned back into potential energy. Objects have potential energy due to their position. A leaf on a tree branch has potential energy. The leafs energy can be turned into motion as it falls.

He identified with the pieds-noirs such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'. Although favouring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pieds-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. From 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for L'Express. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\". When he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals. Camus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyesvsky's Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris. It was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force: 33 actors, 4 hours long, 7 sets, 24 scenes. The walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations. Camus put the painter and set decorator Mayo, who had already illustrated several of Camus' novels (The Stranger - 1948 Ed.), in charge of the demanding task of designing these multiple and complex theater sets. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many theater sets did Mayo the set decorator have to design?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>24</Answer>",

According to Lindsay, FEMA has already received 44,000 inspection requests in Texas. The number of individuals seeking relief from the floods across South Texas increased by more than 1,000 Tuesday, bringing the total to 5,855, he said. FEMA has already distributed $1.8 million in relief in the form of emergency housing. \"The registration process is going rapidly,\" Lindsay said, adding that most registrations took between 5 and 7 minutes. Aid also is available from the local chapter of the Red Cross, but flooding victims must interview with the Red Cross separately to receive aid from them, too.

The hyenas, snarling, rushed past him and were lost to view in the blackness of the interior. Bukawai replaced the saplings and seizing Tibo roughly by the arm, dragged him along a narrow, rocky passage.

The collapse happened around 4 p.m., one hour before spectators were set to begin streaming in for a concert by the alternative rock group Radiohead. Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. \"Unfortunately, four people were hurt,\" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. \"The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area.\" Firefighters arrived to find one man \"trapped under the structure,\" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance.

Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, \"immediately rendered aid,\" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo.

Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia.

Caterpillar's French staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs. It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations. Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said. About 500 employees were also outside the building protesting. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What company does Nicolas Polutnik work for?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>CNN</Answer>",

The general tone of the players is far higher than it was and there has come into evidence a marked improvement in the spirit of the men who own Base Ball clubs.  In the earlier history of the sport there was a tendency to win by any means that did not actually cross the line of dishonesty.  Later there came a season when the commercial end of the game tended to encroach upon the limits of the pastime.

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement. Callisthenes had fallen out of favor by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What are some of the things Alexander required that Greeks thought made Alexander seem like he was trying to deify himself?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Elements of Persian dress and customs</Answer>",

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many trips has Dennis Rodman made to North Korea in under 12 months?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>2</Answer>",

However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties. In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

The hyenas, snarling, rushed past him and were lost to view in the blackness of the interior.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>There are more than 30 attorneys in Butler County that volunteer for an organization offering free legal services for low income or elderly households. Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail. But he's entitled to have a public defender ... Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\" LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients. Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program. One local Springfield attorney volunteered to handle the case.\" </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many attorneys in Butler County that volunteer?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>243</Answer>",

In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from Amphipolis, he traveled east into the country of the \"Independent Thracians\"; and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.

He was moving out of the railed enclosure when Andrews called him by name. \"His honor,\" he said impressively, \"wishes to speak to you.\" The judge leaned over his desk and shook Mr. Thorndike by the hand. Then he made a speech. The speech was about public-spirited citizens who, to the neglect of their own interests, came to assist the ends of justice, and fellow-creatures in misfortune. He purposely spoke in a loud voice, and every one stopped to listen. \"The law, Mr. Thorndike, is not vindictive,\" he said. \"It wishes only to be just.

Like ice wedging, abrasion does not change the rock into another type of rock. With abrasion, one rock or piece of sediment bumps against another rock. Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind.

However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.

Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace.

Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France.

The opening was low and narrow. A few saplings bound together with strips of rawhide closed it against stray beasts. Bukawai removed the primitive door and pushed Tibo within. The hyenas, snarling, rushed past him and were lost to view in the blackness of the interior. Bukawai replaced the saplings and seizing Tibo roughly by the arm, dragged him along a narrow, rocky passage. The floor was comparatively smooth, for the dirt which lay thick upon it had been trodden and tramped by many feet until few inequalities remained. The passage was tortuous, and as it was very dark and the walls rough and rocky, Tibo was scratched and bruised from the many bumps he received. Bukawai walked as rapidly through the winding gallery as one would traverse a familiar lane by daylight. He knew every twist and turn as a mother knows the face of her child, and he seemed to be in a hurry. He jerked poor little Tibo possibly a trifle more ruthlessly than necessary even at the pace Bukawai set; but the old witch-doctor, an outcast from the society of man, diseased, shunned, hated, feared, was far from possessing an angelic temper. Nature had given him few of the kindlier characteristics of man, and these few Fate had eradicated entirely. Shrewd, cunning, cruel, vindictive, was Bukawai, the witch-doctor. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Were the walls and the floor of the cave smooth?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Yes</Answer>",

On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism. He said that \"one of the nation's most fundamental responsibilities is to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.\" The budget guidance issued the next day, however, highlighted gun crimes, narcotics trafficking, and civil rights as priorities. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What did the FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism believed the Justice Department wanted the FBI to do?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Building a budget for fiscal year 2003</Answer>",

That amount hardly offset enormous cuts, beginning in 1996, by Congress to Legal Services Corp., the chief funding source for state legal-aid agencies. Threatened with extinction, LSEO clawed its way back with the help of state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way. Meanwhile, the clients keep coming. At least three-quarters are women and children living in poverty. The agency helps more than 12,000 children a year. A third of LSEO's clients are the working poor who receive no government benefits. Many are senior citizens. Riggs regrets that retired Tulsa attorney John Athens, a champion of legal aid, did not live to see how much the money has meant. Athens died last year. In his honor, The Oxley Foundation donated $200,000 to expand a client hot line. That service, which will be expanded statewide, enables needy people to consult an attorney about civil legal problems, including rent and contract disputes, domestic abuse, consumer issues and custody matters. Attorneys handle no criminal cases. R.H.

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail.

The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.

Vowed celibacy was abominable to her, because it was the resource of the Roman Catholics; and because she had been taught to believe that convent-walls were screens for hiding unheard-of wickedness. But yet, on behalf of her child, she desired seclusion from the world, fancying that so and so only might security be ensured. Superstition was as strong with her as with any self-flagellated nun. Fasting, under that name, she held in abhorrence. But all sensual gratifications were wicked in her sight. She would allow all home indulgences to her daughter, each under some separate plea,--constrained to do so by excessive love; but she did so always in fear and trembling, lest she was giving some foothold to Satan. All of which Robert Bolton understood better even than did his father when he gave the above advice in reference to this lover. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was afraid of the world?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Her daughter</Answer>",

He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian King and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties. In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy and Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Before Alexander sought refuge in Illyria, what family member did he leave with King Alexander I?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>His brother</Answer>",

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What position, independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, was created in 1947?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>DCI</Answer>",

The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators. These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers. The professors expect to make their study available through a Web site, www.eeo1.com. The Blumrosens, who were instrumental in setting up the E.E.O.C. in 1965, also say the government should make more active use of their data. The commission said it did not comment on draft reports. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What kind of discrimination was found and was suggestion made to the government?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Hardcore discrimination found.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>For what reason did King Henry VIII start the \"Rough Wooing\"?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>To force the Scots to allow the betrothal of Mary Stuart to his son Edward, to keep Scotland under his control</Answer>",

The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What is the \"paradise\" they are talking about?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Paris</Answer>",

As Earth orbits the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere goes from winter to spring, then summer and fall. The Southern Hemisphere does the opposite from summer to fall to winter to spring. When it is winter in the Northern hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa. What does this mean for you? If you live in North America, July 1 is usually a very warm day. If you traveled to Southern Australia, you would need a heavy coat. At the equator, the seasons never change. As a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same. There is no summer and winter as we know them. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>When does the North Pole point directly at the sun?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>June 21</Answer>",

There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root\u2014too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why was Spain so isolated and what event happened that allowed Mallorca and Menorca to see explosions in tourism?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The end of Franco's ruling</Answer>",

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace.

Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was \"toi kratistoi\"--\"to the strongest\". Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him. Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \"The Successors\" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: Ptolemaic Egypt, Selucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon.

The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators. These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers. The professors expect to make their study available through a Web site, www.eeo1.com. The Blumrosens, who were instrumental in setting up the E.E.O.C. in 1965, also say the government should make more active use of their data. The commission said it did not comment on draft reports. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which school conducted the study and by whom?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Blumrosens</Answer>",

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail.

Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Where does the CIA submit recommendations for organizational changes based on information collected?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The President</Answer>",

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What did Henry VIII hear that made him think he had a chance to subdue Scotland?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Queen Mary of Scots was crowned</Answer>",

This means that as the Earth rotates, one hemisphere has longer days with shorter nights. At the same time the other hemisphere has shorter days and longer nights. For example, in the Northern hemisphere summer begins on June 21. On this date, the North Pole is pointed directly toward the Sun. This is the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. The South Pole is pointed The hemisphere that is tilted away from the Sun is cooler because it receives fewer direct rays. As Earth orbits the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere goes from winter to spring, then summer and fall. The Southern Hemisphere does the opposite from summer to fall to winter to spring. When it is winter in the Northern hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa. What does this mean for you? If you live in North America, July 1 is usually a very warm day. If you traveled to Southern Australia, you would need a heavy coat. At the equator, the seasons never change. As a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.

In August 2011, the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot, but Camus's biographer, Olivier Todd, did not consider it credible. Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Lourmarin, Vaucluse, France. He was the second-youngest recipient, at the age of 44, of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after Rudyard Kipling, at the age of 42. He was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine, who hold the copyrights to his work. Two of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first, entitled A Happy Death (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to The Stranger's Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, The First Man (1995), which Camus was writing before he died.

In 1914, the couple separated; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called \"Tete\" (for petit), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, including full-time after her death. The marriage with Maric does not seem to have been very happy. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be\" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Elsa Lowenthal on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912.

Think about a trip you and your family made in the car. Maybe the trip covered 120 miles and it took 3 hours. What was the cars speed? speed = 120 mi = 40 mi/h 3h The speed of a car may also be expressed in kilometers per hour (km/h). The SI unit for speed is meters per second (m/s).

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia. They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western-oriented population during the Crimean War and during the Polish uprising.

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many male models were featured in the current video</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>0</Answer>",

A residence in England gave him much valuable knowledge as to the working of representative institutions. He established in 1847 a political newspaper, and went into parliament as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. In 1848 he used all his influence to induce the government to make war with Austria; and when Charles Albert abdicated, and Victor Emmanuel became king, Cavour's great talents were rewarded.

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.

His liberal sentiments made him distrusted by the government of Charles Felix as a dangerous man, and he was doomed to an inactive life in an unimportant post. He soon quitted the army, and embarked in business operations as manager of one of the estates of his family. For twelve years he confined himself to agricultural labors, making himself acquainted with all the details of business and with the science of agriculture, introducing such improvements as the use of guano, and promoting agricultural associations; but he was not indifferent at the same time to public affairs, being one of the most zealous advocates of constitutional liberty. A residence in England gave him much valuable knowledge as to the working of representative institutions. He established in 1847 a political newspaper, and went into parliament as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. In 1848 he used all his influence to induce the government to make war with Austria; and when Charles Albert abdicated, and Victor Emmanuel became king, Cavour's great talents were rewarded. In 1850 he became minister of commerce; in 1852, prime minister.

Her law practice grew to an organization that brought in millions of dollars of damages through its cases against L.A. slumlords, allowing poor families to set up college funds and buy homes. In all those years, she never lost a case. When she stepped down, she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty law. \"I realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole generation of public-interest lawyers,\" she said. \"It had gone from being an economic sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic impossibility. ...

Almost every person who walks into a free medical clinic, she said, faces some legal problem such as an eviction or the loss of Social Security benefits. And many of her clients had medical problems from living in slum housing such as cockroaches lodged in ear canals and rat bite fever, a nonfatal malady that particularly affects children. Mintie noticed that health-care professionals were graduating with staggering debts and also couldn't afford to work with the poor. Her work was noticed by Oprah Winfrey, who invited her on the TV show March 26, 2001.

Robert Menendez. With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez. While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Where did the raid occur and which departments were asked to investigate it?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>South Florida, Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation</Answer>",

They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN.

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which independent agency collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Homeland Security</Answer>",

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement.

However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son.

Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it \"his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir.\" The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Gurlitt's representative said that with the art collector's death, the investigation into the collection ceases.

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine in order to produce a safety video?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Lufstansa</Answer>",

There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root\u2014too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which king brought democracy to Spain and was democracy successful?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>King Juan Carlos I</Answer>",

Mr. Allan did not have that affection for him which Mrs. Allan had. He did not understand the boy's peculiar and erratic nature, and was particularly displeased when he found that Edgar had run into debt at college. There was an angry scene between the two, and Edgar was told that he must leave the university and go into the counting-room. It appears that he made some attempt to tie himself down to figures and accounts and business routine; but as he had not been brought up to this kind of life, he soon tired of it, and decided to go into the world to seek his own fortune. He went to Boston, where he published a volume of poetry. In the preface to this volume, Poe says that the poems were written before he was fourteen. Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were. While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them. This gentleman advised against it on the ground that it would make Edgar conceited,--a fault from which he was already suffering. As soon as he was free to do as he pleased, therefore, it was natural that he should rewrite his poems and publish them. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What is the full name of the person described?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Poe Allan</Answer>",

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What was Dennis Rodman's response when asked about his trip in regards to US detainee in North Korea?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>It is truly a sad state of affairs</Answer>",

Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia. They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western-oriented population during the Crimean War and during the Polish uprising.

Because of Andrews he was tolerated. Because Andrews had a pull he was permitted to sit as an equal among police-court lawyers. No longer was he Arnold Thorndike. He was merely the man \"with Mr. Andrews.\" Then even Andrews abandoned him. \"The judge'll be here in a minute, now,\" said the assistant district attorney, and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the judge's bench. There he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of Mr. Andrews. Seated on the rail, with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to Mr. Thorndike, they laughed and talked together. The subject of their discourse was one Mike Donlin, as he appeared in vaudeville. To Mr. Thorndike it was evident that young Andrews had entirely forgotten him. He arose, and touched his sleeve. With infinite sarcasm Mr. Thorndike began: \"My engagements are not pressing, but\u2014\" A court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail. \"Sit down!\" whispered Andrews. \"The judge is coming.\" Mr. Thorndike sat down. The court attendant droned loudly words Mr. Thorndike could not distinguish.

The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.

There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root\u2014too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why was Spain so isolated and what event happened that allowed Mallorca and Menorca to see explosions in tourism?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The oppressive rule of Franco</Answer>",

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What percentage of intelligence spending do these intelligence agencies housed under the Department of Defense receive and why?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>80 percent - tactical needs</Answer>",

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail.

Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. \"Unfortunately, four people were hurt,\" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. \"The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area.\" Firefighters arrived to find one man \"trapped under the structure,\" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance.

Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, \"immediately rendered aid,\" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said.

In May 1904, the couple's first son, Hans Albert Einstein, was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their second son, Eduard, was born in Zurich in July 1910. In 1914, the couple separated; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called \"Tete\" (for petit), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, including full-time after her death. The marriage with Maric does not seem to have been very happy. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be\" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Elsa Lowenthal on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally. In 1933, they emigrated to the United States. In 1935, Elsa Einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems; she died in December 1936. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How long were Einstein and Maric married before their second child was born?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>16 years</Answer>",

We know that changes in motion require a force. We know that the size of the force determines the change in motion. How much an objects motion changes when a force is applied depends on two things. It depends on the strength of the force. It also depends on the objects mass. Think about some simple tasks you may regularly do. You may pick up a baseball.

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005\u20131034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>When the Romans invaded Scotland in A.D. 78-84, which group did they drive out?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The Votadini</Answer>",

One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it \"his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir.\" The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Gurlitt's representative said that with the art collector's death, the investigation into the collection ceases. The court that was handling the investigation proceedings will now function as an estate court in the case. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why did German prosecutors initially seize over 1,200 paintings from Gurlitt's apartment?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud</Answer>",

Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander.

Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were. While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them. This gentleman advised against it on the ground that it would make Edgar conceited,--a fault from which he was already suffering.

FEMA has already distributed $1.8 million in relief in the form of emergency housing. \"The registration process is going rapidly,\" Lindsay said, adding that most registrations took between 5 and 7 minutes. Aid also is available from the local chapter of the Red Cross, but flooding victims must interview with the Red Cross separately to receive aid from them, too. Daletta Andreas, Hill Country chapter executive director, said the chapter has received calls from people who thought registering with FEMA or for cleanup services from local groups automatically registered them for Red Cross services. That's incorrect, Andreas said. \"They need to come in and go through our interview process,\" she said. The Red Cross service center, 333 Earl Garrett St., is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, and will be open this weekend, Andreas said. People seeking assistance must provide identification proving they reside in the area. Members of the State Bar of Texas are offering free legal advice for flood victims. Victims in Texas counties declared a federal disaster can call (800) 504-7030 for assistance with basic legal questions. The free legal assistance hotline, operated in coordination with Texas Rural Legal Aid and volunteer lawyers from across the state, will be available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What organization is Lindsey registering people through?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Hill Country</Answer>",

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was cousin to Elizabeth Tudor?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Mary Stuart</Answer>",

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine in order to produce a safety video?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Air New Zealand</Answer>",

Mr. Allan did not have that affection for him which Mrs. Allan had. He did not understand the boy's peculiar and erratic nature, and was particularly displeased when he found that Edgar had run into debt at college. There was an angry scene between the two, and Edgar was told that he must leave the university and go into the counting-room. It appears that he made some attempt to tie himself down to figures and accounts and business routine; but as he had not been brought up to this kind of life, he soon tired of it, and decided to go into the world to seek his own fortune. He went to Boston, where he published a volume of poetry. In the preface to this volume, Poe says that the poems were written before he was fourteen. Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were. While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them. This gentleman advised against it on the ground that it would make Edgar conceited,--a fault from which he was already suffering. As soon as he was free to do as he pleased, therefore, it was natural that he should rewrite his poems and publish them. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was Mr. Allan?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Father of Edgar</Answer>",

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret. Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work.

Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization.

But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization.

Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret. Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work. The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, as they are today. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What should the United States do instead of concentrating on two entities to carry out secret military operations?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity</Answer>",

Ross, a veteran Indian fighter, but too old to withstand the hardships of a winter campaign against Indians. The men were all poorly provided with clothing and bedding, most all having taken only what they could strap behind their saddles, but in spite of this and a temperature often below zero, no murmur was heard, and all anxiously, eagerly looked forward to a meeting with the brutal savage murderers of their fellow citizens.

Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c. Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters.

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Does the DCI have any affiliation with the CIA?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Yes</Answer>",

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>For what reason did Mary Stuart return to Scotland at age 18?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>She had been married to the Dauphin of France, but he died shortly afterwards</Answer>",

He identified with the pieds-noirs such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'. Although favouring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pieds-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. From 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for L'Express. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\". When he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals. Camus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyesvsky's Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris. It was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force: 33 actors, 4 hours long, 7 sets, 24 scenes. The walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations.

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005\u20131034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was Kenneth MacAlpin's great-great-great Grandson?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Scone</Answer>",

Like ice wedging, abrasion does not change the rock into another type of rock. With abrasion, one rock or piece of sediment bumps against another rock. Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind. It is like sand-blasting a rock. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What two types of movement could gravity cause in rocks?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>They may fall off a cliff</Answer>",

Robert Menendez. With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez. While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What information came out in March?

On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism. He said that \"one of the nation's most fundamental responsibilities is to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.\" The budget guidance issued the next day, however, highlighted gun crimes, narcotics trafficking, and civil rights as priorities. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who said that \"one of the nation's most fundamental responsibilities is to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.\"</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson</Answer>",

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>This week, we've been treated to the increasingly familiar sight of former NBA star and provocateur Dennis Rodman attending events in Pyongyang, North Korea. It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What animal was Kim Jong Un's uncle rumored to have been feed to?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Social media</Answer>",

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>True or false: The DCI has line authority over the heads of the departments of Defense, State, Justice and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>False</Answer>",

In all those years, she never lost a case. When she stepped down, she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty law. \"I realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole generation of public-interest lawyers,\" she said. \"It had gone from being an economic sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic impossibility. ...

He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the event of any attacks on U.S. interests, anywhere, by  Bin Laden. He further proposed to Berger that a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan-a proposal not adopted. Warned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the millennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 and decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots. Michael Sheehan, the State Department member of the CSG, communicated warnings to the Taliban that they would be held responsible for future al Qaeda attacks.\" Mike was not diplomatic,\" Clarke reported to Berger. With virtually no evidence of a Taliban response, a new approach was made to Pakistan. 13 General Anthony Zinni, the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM), was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to \"take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time.\" But Zinni came back emptyhanded. As Ambassador William Milam reported from Islamabad, Musharraf was \"unwilling to take the political heat at home.\" The CIA worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye on suspected  Bin Laden associates. Tenet spoke to 20 of his foreign counterparts. Disruption and arrest operations were mounted against terrorists in eight countries. In mid-December, President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification (MON) giving the CIA broader authority to use foreign proxies to detain  Bin Laden lieutenants, without having to transfer them to U.S. custody. The authority was to capture, not kill, though lethal force might be used if necessary.16Tenet would later send a message to all CIA personnel overseas, saying, \"The threat could not be more real. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What did the document President Clinton signed achieve?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Giving Pakistan the authority to transfer UBL to the U.S</Answer>",

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement. Callisthenes had fallen out of favor by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What are the details of the second plot on Alexander's life in the Central Asian campaign?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Instigated by his own royal pages</Answer>",

He identified with the pieds-noirs such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'. Although favouring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pieds-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. From 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for L'Express. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\". When he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals. Camus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyesvsky's Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris. It was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force: 33 actors, 4 hours long, 7 sets, 24 scenes. The walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations. Camus put the painter and set decorator Mayo, who had already illustrated several of Camus' novels (The Stranger - 1948 Ed.), in charge of the demanding task of designing these multiple and complex theater sets. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Antoine Theatre</Answer>",

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What states were the drugs shipped to?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Florida</Answer>",

When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy? Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy. This stored energy is called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position. For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall. They fall because of the pull of gravity. Potential energy can be transferred into motion. Motion can also be turned back into potential energy. Objects have potential energy due to their position.

Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter about his girl back on Earth and that all-expenses-paid vacation-for-two she won last time he was on leave.

In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew.

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.

The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.

It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations. Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What does the CIA do and who is the agency's number one customer?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The CIA acts as an independent agency that collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources.

According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was \"toi kratistoi\"--\"to the strongest\". Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him. Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \"The Successors\" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: Ptolemaic Egypt, Selucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was cousin to Elizabeth Tudor?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Lord Darnley</Answer>",

Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c. Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters.

Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were. While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them.

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret. Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work. The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, as they are today. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Before 9/11, who relied on proxies instead of developing a robust capabilities?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>CIA</Answer>",

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Besides Elizabeth, who else did Mary Stuart clash with?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Anything else</Answer>",

The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.

In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from Amphipolis, he traveled east into the country of the \"Independent Thracians\"; and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities.

He was also the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Finland. Alexander was the most successful Russian reformer since Peter the Great. His most important achievement was the emancipation of serfs in 1861, for which he became known as Alexander the Liberator (Russian: Aleksandr Osvoboditel', tr. Aleksandr Osvoboditel; IPA: [aljI'ksandr asv@ba'djitjIlj]). The tsar was responsible for numerous other reforms including reorganizing the judicial system, setting up elected local judges, abolishing capital punishment, promoting local self-government through the zemstvo system, imposing universal military service, ending some of the privileges of the nobility, and promoting the universities. Despite these reforms, during his reign, his brutal secret police, known as the Third Section, sent thousands of dissidents into exile in Siberia. In foreign policy, Alexander sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, fearing the remote colony would fall into British hands if there was another war. He sought peace, moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871, and in 1872 joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation. Despite his otherwise pacifistic foreign policy, he fought a brief war with Turkey in 1877-78, pursued further expansion into Siberia and the Caucasus, and conquered Turkestan. Although disappointed by the results of the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Alexander abided by that agreement. Among his greatest domestic challenges was an uprising in Poland in 1863, to which he responded by stripping that land of its separate Constitution and incorporating it directly into Russia. Alexander was proposing additional parliamentary reforms to counter the rise of nascent revolutionary and anarchistic movements when he was assassinated in 1881. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many years after the end of the war with Turkey was Alexander II assassinated?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>10</Answer>",

She too had once been tall, but now old age gave her a withered, witch-like appearance, in spite of her great height.  She was dressed in limp, faded garments, with a tattered shawl crossed over her chest, and had a scared, miserable look in her bleared old eyes.  There were a few words of explanation from the man who had come home, and then, in gruff but not unkindly tones, he bade Babette be seated, and told his mother to get some supper speedily.  She spread a coarse cloth on the wooden table, and when all was ready, lifted a large black saucepan from the stove and turned out a smoking, savoury-looking stew.  The youngest son produced a bottle containing the thin acid wine of the country, and another of spirits.  As he set them on the table, Babette noticed that across one of his hands, which were much smaller and whiter than those of his brothers, there ran a dull red scar that looked as if he had had a bad cut there.  Then they all sat down, excepting the old mother, who busied herself in waiting on them. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who appears to be older, the woman or the man?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The man</Answer>",

Spear was free, and from different parts of the courtroom people were moving toward the door. Their numbers showed that the friends of the young man had been many. Mr. Thorndike felt a certain twinge of disappointment. Even though the result relieved and pleased him, he wished, in bringing it about, he had had some part. He begrudged to Isaacs & Sons the credit of having given Spear his liberty. His morning had been wasted. He had neglected his own interests, and in no way assisted those of Spear. He was moving out of the railed enclosure when Andrews called him by name. \"His honor,\" he said impressively, \"wishes to speak to you.\" The judge leaned over his desk and shook Mr. Thorndike by the hand. Then he made a speech. The speech was about public-spirited citizens who, to the neglect of their own interests, came to assist the ends of justice, and fellow-creatures in misfortune. He purposely spoke in a loud voice, and every one stopped to listen. \"The law, Mr. Thorndike, is not vindictive,\" he said. \"It wishes only to be just. Nor can it be swayed by wealth or political or social influences. But when there is good in a man, I, personally, want to know it, and when gentlemen like yourself, of your standing in this city, come here to speak a good word for a man, we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen. I thank you for coming, and I wish more of our citizens were as unselfish and public-spirited.\" It was all quite absurd and most embarrassing, but inwardly Mr. Thorndike glowed with pleasure.

He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian King and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties. In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy and Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>After learning that the Persian satrap of Caria offered his eldest daughter to his half brother, who did Alexander send to tell Pixodarus that he should offer her hand to him instead?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Thessalus of Corinth,</Answer>",

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\" LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail.

Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

Then fall from the trees to the ground. As the leaves are falling, they have kinetic energy. While they are still attached to the trees they also have energy. When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy? Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy. This stored energy is called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position. For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall. They fall because of the pull of gravity. Potential energy can be transferred into motion. Motion can also be turned back into potential energy. Objects have potential energy due to their position. A leaf on a tree branch has potential energy. The leafs energy can be turned into motion as it falls.

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972. At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What is the name of the psychologist who is known as the originator of social learning theory?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Jordan</Answer>",

The collapse happened around 4 p.m., one hour before spectators were set to begin streaming in for a concert by the alternative rock group Radiohead. Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. \"Unfortunately, four people were hurt,\" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. \"The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area.\" Firefighters arrived to find one man \"trapped under the structure,\" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance. They helped to extricate the man, then moved away from what was then still considered an \"unstable structure,\" Bellavance added. Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, \"immediately rendered aid,\" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said. At the time it came down, the weather was good with no storm rolling through or significant winds, added fellow police Constable Harrison Ford. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What was the weather reported to be like when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above crashed onto a stage in a Toronto park Saturday afternoon?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>A storm was rolling in</Answer>",

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which independent Agency collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from its sources?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Justice</Answer>",

He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\" By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years. Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections. And in this network,  Bin Laden's agenda stood out. While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya,  Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the \"far enemy\"-the United States. After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction.

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972. At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who is the originator of social learning theory?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Albert Bandura OC</Answer>",

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it \"his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir.\" The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Gurlitt's representative said that with the art collector's death, the investigation into the collection ceases. The court that was handling the investigation proceedings will now function as an estate court in the case. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why did German prosecutors initially seize over 1,200 paintings from Gurlitt's apartment?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Because he stole them from the museum</Answer>",

FEMA has already distributed $1.8 million in relief in the form of emergency housing. \"The registration process is going rapidly,\" Lindsay said, adding that most registrations took between 5 and 7 minutes. Aid also is available from the local chapter of the Red Cross, but flooding victims must interview with the Red Cross separately to receive aid from them, too. Daletta Andreas, Hill Country chapter executive director, said the chapter has received calls from people who thought registering with FEMA or for cleanup services from local groups automatically registered them for Red Cross services. That's incorrect, Andreas said. \"They need to come in and go through our interview process,\" she said. The Red Cross service center, 333 Earl Garrett St., is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, and will be open this weekend, Andreas said.

Threatened with extinction, LSEO clawed its way back with the help of state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way. Meanwhile, the clients keep coming. At least three-quarters are women and children living in poverty. The agency helps more than 12,000 children a year. A third of LSEO's clients are the working poor who receive no government benefits. Many are senior citizens. Riggs regrets that retired Tulsa attorney John Athens, a champion of legal aid, did not live to see how much the money has meant. Athens died last year. In his honor, The Oxley Foundation donated $200,000 to expand a client hot line. That service, which will be expanded statewide, enables needy people to consult an attorney about civil legal problems, including rent and contract disputes, domestic abuse, consumer issues and custody matters. Attorneys handle no criminal cases. R.H.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content> Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia. He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\" By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years. Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections. And in this network,  Bin Laden's agenda stood out. While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya,  Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the \"far enemy\"-the United States. After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction. In December, bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U.S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, killing two, but no Americans. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who is  Bin Laden referring to when he refers to \"the head of the snake\"?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>al Qaeda</Answer>",

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What does the CIA do and who is the agency's number one customer?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The CIA's number one customer is the president of Canada</Answer>",

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What kind of career does Christie Brinkley have?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>A model</Answer>",

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>Durer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominately in private collections located in only a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Parmigianino, all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work. His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the \"Little Masters\" who attempted few large engravings but continued Durer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. Lucas van Leyden was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Durer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds (Giulio Campagnola and Christofano Robetta), or whole prints (Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano). However, Durer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also. In painting, Durer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Durer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the Durer Renaissance of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945. Durer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by D'Arcy Thompson in his book On Growth and Form. The Lutheran Church remembers Durer as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Burgkmair. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and Matthias Grunewald on August 5. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who is the artist with the longest name that was influenced by Durer to use the printmaking medium?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Raphael</Answer>",

They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN.

In 1914, the couple separated; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called \"Tete\" (for petit), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, including full-time after her death. The marriage with Maric does not seem to have been very happy. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be\" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Elsa Lowenthal on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912.

Leigh on screenwriting: \"I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process.\" In that time, he has been nominated for five Oscars, as well as winning the Best Director award at Cannes Film Festival for \"Naked\" in 1993, the Palme d'Or there for \"Secrets & Lies\" in 1996 and the Leono d'Oro at Venice Film Festival in 2004 for \"Vera Drake.\" Famous for his fierce independence (read refusal to work in Hollywood), Leigh's work is known for gritty realism and a focus on underprivileged sections of British society. Another of Leigh's calling cards is an unconventional approach to screenwriting. \"The Screening Room\" caught up with the veteran director at the International Screenwriters' Festival in the UK earlier this year to ask him more about his approach to making films. The Screening Room: Why is this festival so important to you? Mike Leigh: I am a filmmaker who is both a writer and director and I have this way of making films where the writing and the actors and the shooting is all combined together. I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process. TSR: What do you think other scriptwriters can learn from you? ML: I think screenwriters who, because of the politics and economics of the film industry, are forced to work in a much more conventional way, are always fascinated to discuss with me how I work.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>LONDON, England (CNN) -- British filmmaker, screenwriter and playwright, Mike Leigh has been in the movie business for over 35 years. Leigh on screenwriting: \"I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process.\" In that time, he has been nominated for five Oscars, as well as winning the Best Director award at Cannes Film Festival for \"Naked\" in 1993, the Palme d'Or there for \"Secrets & Lies\" in 1996 and the Leono d'Oro at Venice Film Festival in 2004 for \"Vera Drake.\" Famous for his fierce independence (read refusal to work in Hollywood), Leigh's work is known for gritty realism and a focus on underprivileged sections of British society. Another of Leigh's calling cards is an unconventional approach to screenwriting. \"The Screening Room\" caught up with the veteran director at the International Screenwriters' Festival in the UK earlier this year to ask him more about his approach to making films. The Screening Room: Why is this festival so important to you? Mike Leigh: I am a filmmaker who is both a writer and director and I have this way of making films where the writing and the actors and the shooting is all combined together. I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process. TSR: What do you think other scriptwriters can learn from you? ML: I think screenwriters who, because of the politics and economics of the film industry, are forced to work in a much more conventional way, are always fascinated to discuss with me how I work. TSR: There is this romantic idea that screenwriting has to be a painful, solitary experience. That's not what you experience, though. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What does the screenwriter experience while writing a screenplay?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Conventional pressures</Answer>",

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>In 1863, Alexander II re-convened the Diet of Finland and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy from Russia including establishment of its own currency, the markka. Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia. They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western-oriented population during the Crimean War and during the Polish uprising. Encouraging Finnish nationalism and language can also be seen as an attempt to dilute ties with Sweden. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What are some reforms that increased Finland's autonomy from Russia?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development</Answer>",

In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from Amphipolis, he traveled east into the country of the \"Independent Thracians\"; and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace. Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What was Alexander's immediate response when Thebes and Athens rebelled?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Headed south</Answer>",

She lived on a $3-a-week stipend that she spent on pantyhose and bus fare. Her law practice grew to an organization that brought in millions of dollars of damages through its cases against L.A. slumlords, allowing poor families to set up college funds and buy homes. In all those years, she never lost a case. When she stepped down, she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty law. \"I realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole generation of public-interest lawyers,\" she said. \"It had gone from being an economic sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic impossibility. ... The whole system has essentially collapsed.\" Mintie also started to ask questions about the medical field. Almost every person who walks into a free medical clinic, she said, faces some legal problem such as an eviction or the loss of Social Security benefits. And many of her clients had medical problems from living in slum housing such as cockroaches lodged in ear canals and rat bite fever, a nonfatal malady that particularly affects children. Mintie noticed that health-care professionals were graduating with staggering debts and also couldn't afford to work with the poor. Her work was noticed by Oprah Winfrey, who invited her on the TV show March 26, 2001. Mintie received a $100,000 \"Use Your Life Award\" from Oprah's Angel Network, a nonprofit organization that awards money to those who help others. Mintie said that all of the money has gone to her recipients -- none was spent on overhead. She will be out of funds by spring. She is trying to get religious organizations to sponsor recipients.

Caterpillar's French staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs. It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations. Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said.

Mr. Allan did not have that affection for him which Mrs. Allan had. He did not understand the boy's peculiar and erratic nature, and was particularly displeased when he found that Edgar had run into debt at college. There was an angry scene between the two, and Edgar was told that he must leave the university and go into the counting-room. It appears that he made some attempt to tie himself down to figures and accounts and business routine; but as he had not been brought up to this kind of life, he soon tired of it, and decided to go into the world to seek his own fortune. He went to Boston, where he published a volume of poetry. In the preface to this volume, Poe says that the poems were written before he was fourteen. Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were. While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them. This gentleman advised against it on the ground that it would make Edgar conceited,--a fault from which he was already suffering. As soon as he was free to do as he pleased, therefore, it was natural that he should rewrite his poems and publish them. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>When Mr. Allan showed Poe's poems to the master of English and Classical studies, what advice was he given?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Support</Answer>",

Think about a trip you and your family made in the car. Maybe the trip covered 120 miles and it took 3 hours. What was the cars speed? speed = 120 mi = 40 mi/h 3h The speed of a car may also be expressed in kilometers per hour (km/h). The SI unit for speed is meters per second (m/s).

Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was \"toi kratistoi\"--\"to the strongest\". Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him. Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \"The Successors\" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: Ptolemaic Egypt, Selucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What is the discrepancy over what Alexander did on his deathbed?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir</Answer>",

The dinosaurs called it `` Saurus Rock '' . The legend also states that if anyone damages the monolith , bad luck would descend upon the valley . A few days later when the kids are playing , Littlefoot accidentally falls off a cliff . Just before he hits the ground , a gruff Diplodocus rescues him . This longneck introduces himself only as `` Doc '' and gives no knowledge of his history . Littlefoot is intrigued by this newcomer , who is scarred across one eye and displays prior knowledge of the Great Valley 's topography . For the preceding reasons , Littlefoot assumes that Doc is the Lone Dinosaur . He tells his friends this , narrating an apparently extemporaneous legend to support his assumption . Inspired , Cera 's infant nieces , the twins Dinah and Dana , go to Saurus Rock without anyone noticing . Later when the friends are playing , they notice that Dinah and Dana are missing . Recalling their talk of the day before , they go to Saurus Rock to find them . </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who is the longneck Littefoot meets and why does he think that he is the Lone Dinosaur?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Doc, because he has a scar across his right eye and knows about the topography of the Great Valley</Answer>",

In August 2011, the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot, but Camus's biographer, Olivier Todd, did not consider it credible. Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Lourmarin, Vaucluse, France. He was the second-youngest recipient, at the age of 44, of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after Rudyard Kipling, at the age of 42. He was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine, who hold the copyrights to his work. Two of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first, entitled A Happy Death (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to The Stranger's Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, The First Man (1995), which Camus was writing before he died.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content>Durer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominately in private collections located in only a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Parmigianino, all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work. His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the \"Little Masters\" who attempted few large engravings but continued Durer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. Lucas van Leyden was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Durer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds (Giulio Campagnola and Christofano Robetta), or whole prints (Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano). However, Durer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also. In painting, Durer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Durer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the Durer Renaissance of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945. Durer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by D'Arcy Thompson in his book On Growth and Form. The Lutheran Church remembers Durer as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Burgkmair. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and Matthias Grunewald on August 5. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who is the artist with the longest name that was influenced by Durer to use the printmaking medium?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Parmigianino</Answer>",

However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties. In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

He soon quitted the army, and embarked in business operations as manager of one of the estates of his family. For twelve years he confined himself to agricultural labors, making himself acquainted with all the details of business and with the science of agriculture, introducing such improvements as the use of guano, and promoting agricultural associations; but he was not indifferent at the same time to public affairs, being one of the most zealous advocates of constitutional liberty. A residence in England gave him much valuable knowledge as to the working of representative institutions. He established in 1847 a political newspaper, and went into parliament as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. In 1848 he used all his influence to induce the government to make war with Austria; and when Charles Albert abdicated, and Victor Emmanuel became king, Cavour's great talents were rewarded.

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages.

Another of Leigh's calling cards is an unconventional approach to screenwriting. \"The Screening Room\" caught up with the veteran director at the International Screenwriters' Festival in the UK earlier this year to ask him more about his approach to making films. The Screening Room: Why is this festival so important to you?

In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace.

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

Then he made a speech. The speech was about public-spirited citizens who, to the neglect of their own interests, came to assist the ends of justice, and fellow-creatures in misfortune. He purposely spoke in a loud voice, and every one stopped to listen. \"The law, Mr. Thorndike, is not vindictive,\" he said. \"It wishes only to be just.

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005\u20131034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How long ago was the Edinburgh area and the Castle Rock known to have been inhabited by humans?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>As early as 900 b.c.e</Answer>",

He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\" By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years. Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections. And in this network,  Bin Laden's agenda stood out. While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya,  Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the \"far enemy\"-the United States. After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction. In December, bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U.S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, killing two, but no Americans. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How did  Bin Laden's agenda differ from his peers?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>He was from Saudi Arabia</Answer>",

He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian King and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties. In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy and Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why did Philip have four of Alexanders friends exiled and have Thessalus brought to him in chains?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>He wanted a better bride for Alexander</Answer>",

Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia.

Caterpillar's French staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs. It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations. Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said. About 500 employees were also outside the building protesting. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What were Caterpillar's French staff angry about?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Layoff</Answer>",

In August 2011, the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot, but Camus's biographer, Olivier Todd, did not consider it credible. Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Lourmarin, Vaucluse, France. He was the second-youngest recipient, at the age of 44, of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after Rudyard Kipling, at the age of 42. He was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine, who hold the copyrights to his work. Two of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first, entitled A Happy Death (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to The Stranger's Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, The First Man (1995), which Camus was writing before he died.

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret. Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work. The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, as they are today. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What are the CIA and the Military known for?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>For CIA's agility and Military's methodical and cumbersome action</Answer>",

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How has the media shown North Korea as the classic enemy?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Showing regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions</Answer>",

He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment.

His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Parmigianino, all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work. His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the \"Little Masters\" who attempted few large engravings but continued Durer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. Lucas van Leyden was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Durer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds (Giulio Campagnola and Christofano Robetta), or whole prints (Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano). However, Durer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also. In painting, Durer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Durer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the Durer Renaissance of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945. Durer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by D'Arcy Thompson in his book On Growth and Form. The Lutheran Church remembers Durer as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Burgkmair. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and Matthias Grunewald on August 5. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who is the artist with the longest name that was influenced by Durer to use the printmaking medium?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Titian</Answer>",

Aleksandr II Nikolaevich; IPA: [aljI'ksandr fta'roj njIka'lajIvjItc]; 29 April [O.S. 17 April] 1818 in Moscow - 13 March [O.S. 1 March] 1881 in Saint Petersburg) was the Emperor of Russia from 2 March 1855 until his assassination in 1881. He was also the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Finland. Alexander was the most successful Russian reformer since Peter the Great. His most important achievement was the emancipation of serfs in 1861, for which he became known as Alexander the Liberator (Russian: Aleksandr Osvoboditel', tr. Aleksandr Osvoboditel; IPA: [aljI'ksandr asv@ba'djitjIlj]). The tsar was responsible for numerous other reforms including reorganizing the judicial system, setting up elected local judges, abolishing capital punishment, promoting local self-government through the zemstvo system, imposing universal military service, ending some of the privileges of the nobility, and promoting the universities. Despite these reforms, during his reign, his brutal secret police, known as the Third Section, sent thousands of dissidents into exile in Siberia. In foreign policy, Alexander sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, fearing the remote colony would fall into British hands if there was another war. He sought peace, moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871, and in 1872 joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation. Despite his otherwise pacifistic foreign policy, he fought a brief war with Turkey in 1877-78, pursued further expansion into Siberia and the Caucasus, and conquered Turkestan. Although disappointed by the results of the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Alexander abided by that agreement. Among his greatest domestic challenges was an uprising in Poland in 1863, to which he responded by stripping that land of its separate Constitution and incorporating it directly into Russia. Alexander was proposing additional parliamentary reforms to counter the rise of nascent revolutionary and anarchistic movements when he was assassinated in 1881. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why is Alexander II called Aleksandr Osvoboditel?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>He emancipated the serfs</Answer>",

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>In addition to helping smuggle weapons to the Dominican Republic, from what country did Mata help import drugs?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Ecuador</Answer>",

Robert Menendez. With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez. While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What three departments were involved in the investigation?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation</Answer>",

View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Which women appeared in the \"Safety in Paradise\" safety video?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Jessica Gomes</Answer>",

In all those years, she never lost a case. When she stepped down, she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty law. \"I realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole generation of public-interest lawyers,\" she said. \"It had gone from being an economic sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic impossibility. ...

Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c.

Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\" By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years. Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections. And in this network,  Bin Laden's agenda stood out. While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya,  Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the \"far enemy\"-the United States. After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction.

Christian activists stage a peace march in Mumbai, India earlier this month. Krishan Kumar, Kandhamal's top administrative official, told CNN the Hindu man was hacked to death at Raikia. Orissa state, which is dominated by tribal people, borders the Bay of Bengal in east-central India, and Kandhamal is located in the center of the state, which has been racked by Hindu-Christian violence. Praveen Kumar, Kandhamal's superintendent of police, said an investigation is under way in both incidents, and did not say whether any suspects were being sought. Twenty-three civilians, excluding police, have died in the Hindu-Christian violence in Kandhamal this month, according to the administrator. \"Arrests are continuing,\" Praveen Kumar said when asked how many people have been held so far in connection with the violence. The latest attacks occurred on a day when India's federal government called upon the state administration to take \"effective, focused and firm measures\" to control the conflicts. On Thursday, federal Home Secretary Madhukar Gupta asked the Orissa government to ensure effective deployment of paramilitaries in the state. -- CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What has India's federal government called upon Orissa state to do to control the conflicts?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>To arrest rebels</Answer>",

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78\u201384, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital\u2002\u2014\u2002along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned)\u2002\u2014\u2002to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005\u20131034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who were the Scots?

He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the event of any attacks on U.S. interests, anywhere, by  Bin Laden. He further proposed to Berger that a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan-a proposal not adopted. Warned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the millennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 and decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots. Michael Sheehan, the State Department member of the CSG, communicated warnings to the Taliban that they would be held responsible for future al Qaeda attacks.\" Mike was not diplomatic,\" Clarke reported to Berger. With virtually no evidence of a Taliban response, a new approach was made to Pakistan. 13 General Anthony Zinni, the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM), was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to \"take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time.\" But Zinni came back emptyhanded. As Ambassador William Milam reported from Islamabad, Musharraf was \"unwilling to take the political heat at home.\" The CIA worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye on suspected  Bin Laden associates. Tenet spoke to 20 of his foreign counterparts. Disruption and arrest operations were mounted against terrorists in eight countries. In mid-December, President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification (MON) giving the CIA broader authority to use foreign proxies to detain  Bin Laden lieutenants, without having to transfer them to U.S. custody. The authority was to capture, not kill, though lethal force might be used if necessary.16Tenet would later send a message to all CIA personnel overseas, saying, \"The threat could not be more real. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>When do the events in the whole article take place?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>On the Millenium</Answer>",

The collapse happened around 4 p.m., one hour before spectators were set to begin streaming in for a concert by the alternative rock group Radiohead. Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. \"Unfortunately, four people were hurt,\" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. \"The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area.\" Firefighters arrived to find one man \"trapped under the structure,\" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance. They helped to extricate the man, then moved away from what was then still considered an \"unstable structure,\" Bellavance added. Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, \"immediately rendered aid,\" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said.

Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c. Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters.

The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.

Threatened with extinction, LSEO clawed its way back with the help of state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way. Meanwhile, the clients keep coming. At least three-quarters are women and children living in poverty. The agency helps more than 12,000 children a year. A third of LSEO's clients are the working poor who receive no government benefits.

That service, which will be expanded statewide, enables needy people to consult an attorney about civil legal problems, including rent and contract disputes, domestic abuse, consumer issues and custody matters.

Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Where does the CIA submit recommendations for organizational changes based on information collected?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The President of the United Stages</Answer>",

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.

The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators. These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers. The professors expect to make their study available through a Web site, www.eeo1.com.

Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail. But he's entitled to have a public defender ... Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\" LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients. Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said. \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program. One local Springfield attorney volunteered to handle the case.\" </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>How many attorneys in Butler County that volunteer?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>30</Answer>",

Robert Menendez. With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez. While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What is true about the claims made about Menendez?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Everything</Answer>",

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois, son of the French king. Fran\u00e7ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth\u2002\u2014\u2002the \"Virgin Queen\"\u2002\u2014\u2002had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James. Within a year, however, Darnley was murdered, and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell, the chief suspect. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What did the Scots refuse to do that sent Henry rampaging through Scotland?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The Scots did not agree to have Henry's son marry Mary</Answer>",

He was also the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Finland. Alexander was the most successful Russian reformer since Peter the Great. His most important achievement was the emancipation of serfs in 1861, for which he became known as Alexander the Liberator (Russian: Aleksandr Osvoboditel', tr. Aleksandr Osvoboditel; IPA: [aljI'ksandr asv@ba'djitjIlj]). The tsar was responsible for numerous other reforms including reorganizing the judicial system, setting up elected local judges, abolishing capital punishment, promoting local self-government through the zemstvo system, imposing universal military service, ending some of the privileges of the nobility, and promoting the universities. Despite these reforms, during his reign, his brutal secret police, known as the Third Section, sent thousands of dissidents into exile in Siberia. In foreign policy, Alexander sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, fearing the remote colony would fall into British hands if there was another war. He sought peace, moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871, and in 1872 joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation. Despite his otherwise pacifistic foreign policy, he fought a brief war with Turkey in 1877-78, pursued further expansion into Siberia and the Caucasus, and conquered Turkestan. Although disappointed by the results of the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Alexander abided by that agreement. Among his greatest domestic challenges was an uprising in Poland in 1863, to which he responded by stripping that land of its separate Constitution and incorporating it directly into Russia. Alexander was proposing additional parliamentary reforms to counter the rise of nascent revolutionary and anarchistic movements when he was assassinated in 1881. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why is Alexander II called Aleksandr Osvoboditel?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>He was know as Aleksandr Osvoboditel because of the emancipation of serfs in 1861</Answer>",

Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alc\u00e1zar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace.

Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him. Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \"The Successors\" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: Ptolemaic Egypt, Selucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon.

In August 2011, the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot, but Camus's biographer, Olivier Todd, did not consider it credible. Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Lourmarin, Vaucluse, France. He was the second-youngest recipient, at the age of 44, of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after Rudyard Kipling, at the age of 42. He was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine, who hold the copyrights to his work. Two of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first, entitled A Happy Death (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to The Stranger's Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, The First Man (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. The novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who was the second youngest person to receive the nobel prize in literature?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Rudyard Kipling</Answer>",

On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism. He said that \"one of the nation's most fundamental responsibilities is to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.\" The budget guidance issued the next day, however, highlighted gun crimes, narcotics trafficking, and civil rights as priorities. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who are John Ashcroft and Dale Watson</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>The attorney general and FBI director</Answer>",

She too had once been tall, but now old age gave her a withered, witch-like appearance, in spite of her great height.  She was dressed in limp, faded garments, with a tattered shawl crossed over her chest, and had a scared, miserable look in her bleared old eyes.  There were a few words of explanation from the man who had come home, and then, in gruff but not unkindly tones, he bade Babette be seated, and told his mother to get some supper speedily.  She spread a coarse cloth on the wooden table, and when all was ready, lifted a large black saucepan from the stove and turned out a smoking, savoury-looking stew.  The youngest son produced a bottle containing the thin acid wine of the country, and another of spirits.  As he set them on the table, Babette noticed that across one of his hands, which were much smaller and whiter than those of his brothers, there ran a dull red scar that looked as if he had had a bad cut there.

That amount hardly offset enormous cuts, beginning in 1996, by Congress to Legal Services Corp., the chief funding source for state legal-aid agencies. Threatened with extinction, LSEO clawed its way back with the help of state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way. Meanwhile, the clients keep coming. At least three-quarters are women and children living in poverty. The agency helps more than 12,000 children a year. A third of LSEO's clients are the working poor who receive no government benefits. Many are senior citizens. Riggs regrets that retired Tulsa attorney John Athens, a champion of legal aid, did not live to see how much the money has meant. Athens died last year. In his honor, The Oxley Foundation donated $200,000 to expand a client hot line. That service, which will be expanded statewide, enables needy people to consult an attorney about civil legal problems, including rent and contract disputes, domestic abuse, consumer issues and custody matters. Attorneys handle no criminal cases. R.H. Harbaugh, foundation trustee and a colleague of Athens at the Conner & Winters law firm, said his mentor had \"a special interest in people who could not afford legal services. He was aware of the hot line and supported its expansion.\" Said Riggs: \"We use lofty phrases such as 'with justice for all,' when we talk about our legal system.

There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root\u2014too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why was Spain so isolated and what event happened that allowed Mallorca and Menorca to see explosions in tourism?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>King Juan Carlos I had isolated Spain, and his death allowed Mallorca and Menorca to see explosions in tourism</Answer>",

Robert Menendez. With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez. While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What has the ongoing investigation turned up about Menendez's involvement?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Nothing</Answer>",

Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia.

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972. At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What year did Albert Bandura study aggression and non-aggression in children?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>2002</Answer>",

Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium. So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in, I heard nothing. After the first whoosh of the air being sucked away, there was lightning, but no thunder. Eyes bulging in panic, but no screams. Quiet and peaceful, right? Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter about his girl back on Earth and that all-expenses-paid vacation-for-two she won last time he was on leave. I swore, if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again, giving the camera a cheesy thumbs-up from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches, I'd kiss a monkey. Metaphorically, of course. Fact: If, before all the air is sucked out of the ship, a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into a space suit, that person has less than twenty-four hours to live. This is more than the person would have sans space suit. Me, I found a space suit, but it was statistically unlikely that I, and whomever else has followed suit (pun intended), would manage to repair our ship before the less-than-twenty-four hours are up; yes, studies have been done. So, twenty-four hours. Give or take.

Smith practiced law for a living until 1982. Since then, he's been semi-retired, devoting himself to helping fellow seniors who are needy. \"I'm getting unable to do much physically, but my brain hasn't quit,\" said Smith, who walks with a cane. \"And I'd rather people ask a foolish question now than have them make a dumb mistake later.\" Smith and Sketchley helped Beatrice Jackson at the Smith Williams Center on Wednesday. Jackson, who said she was \"over 60,\" needed help with estate planning. \"He's not through with me yet ... but he's done a real good job,\" said Jackson, a retired state worker. Over the years, Smith said, he's helped clients with not only wills but also adoptions, divorces and even animal control cases. \"Someone's cat was bit by a dog, as I recall,\" he said.

Mr. Allan did not have that affection for him which Mrs. Allan had. He did not understand the boy's peculiar and erratic nature, and was particularly displeased when he found that Edgar had run into debt at college. There was an angry scene between the two, and Edgar was told that he must leave the university and go into the counting-room. It appears that he made some attempt to tie himself down to figures and accounts and business routine; but as he had not been brought up to this kind of life, he soon tired of it, and decided to go into the world to seek his own fortune. He went to Boston, where he published a volume of poetry. In the preface to this volume, Poe says that the poems were written before he was fourteen. Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were. While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them. This gentleman advised against it on the ground that it would make Edgar conceited,--a fault from which he was already suffering. As soon as he was free to do as he pleased, therefore, it was natural that he should rewrite his poems and publish them. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>When was his poetry written that was published in Boston?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>According to the preface, they were written before he was 14</Answer>",

The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.

They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said.

The new Community Legal Center at 205 N. 400 West is a project of \"And Justice for All,\" which, until this venture, has been a joint fund-raising campaign by an alliance of the non-profit providers of free legal services. \"And Justice for All,\" which solicits donations primarily from Utah lawyers and foundations, was the first joint fund-raising campaign of legal services agencies in the country, and the Community Legal Center is the first joint office project of public service law groups. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility, and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway. It has its own parking, something that's hard to find downtown and which has been a problem for staff as well as clients. Owning and sharing the building and not paying rent times five will save the non-profit agencies about $375,000 each year. My assistant, Charity Christenson, pointed out that the shared facility will also be efficient for those needing legal services. No longer will a woman desperate for a protective order, for example, have to run all over town trying to find the right agency. After the tour, we found Jaye Olafson at the cookies and brownies reception on the first floor. Jaye and her husband, Erik, own Tomax Technologies and were the sellers of the building. Jaye explained how much of the renovation had been merely uncovering what was already there. The hardwood floors, wooden ceilings and brick and stone interior walls were all hidden behind coverings and old paint. She loves the building, and they only moved out because the business had outgrown the space. So they renovated the old Sweet Candy Company building for Tomax.

        "input": "First, here is the conversation content:<Conversation Content> Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia. He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\" By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years. Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections. And in this network,  Bin Laden's agenda stood out.

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Why is the US considered a passive player in the story of Rodman and North Korea?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>They have only supported his trips</Answer>",

It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret.

There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root\u2014too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What major event made the country of Spain so eager to capitalize on mass tourism?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>King Juan Carlos I came into power</Answer>",

When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy? Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy. This stored energy is called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position. For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall. They fall because of the pull of gravity. Potential energy can be transferred into motion. Motion can also be turned back into potential energy. Objects have potential energy due to their position.

But when there is good in a man, I, personally, want to know it, and when gentlemen like yourself, of your standing in this city, come here to speak a good word for a man, we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen. I thank you for coming, and I wish more of our citizens were as unselfish and public-spirited.\" It was all quite absurd and most embarrassing, but inwardly Mr. Thorndike glowed with pleasure. It was a long time since any one had had the audacity to tell him he had done well. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>What was the beginning of the judge's speech mainly about?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Public-spirited citizens</Answer>",

To determine speed you must know two things. First, you must know how far something travels. Second, you need to know how long it takes to travel that far. Speed can be calculated using this formula: speed = distance time A familiar example is the speed of a car. In the U.S., this is usually expressed in miles per hour. Think about a trip you and your family made in the car. Maybe the trip covered 120 miles and it took 3 hours. What was the cars speed? speed = 120 mi = 40 mi/h 3h The speed of a car may also be expressed in kilometers per hour (km/h). The SI unit for speed is meters per second (m/s).

By the time I had finished the ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows.  My search had shown me nothing fresh.  Everything appeared to be in order, and I was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when the thought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the cellars.  I had not, if I remember rightly, been into them since my hasty search on the evening of the attack.  For, perhaps, the half of a minute, I hesitated.  I would have been very willing to forego the task--as, indeed, I am inclined to think any man well might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, the cellars are the hugest and weirdest.  Great, gloomy caverns of places, unlit by any ray of daylight.  Yet, I would not shirk the work.  I felt that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice.  Besides, as I reassured myself, the cellars were really the most unlikely places in which to come across anything dangerous; considering that they can be entered, only through a heavy oaken door, the key of which, I carry always on my person. </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>When did the person consider extinguishing the candle?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>In the cellar</Answer>",

Joey and Jimmy played silly games together, and were always laughing. One day, Joey and Jimmy went swimming together at their Aunt Julie's pond. Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left. He couldn't find anything to eat except for pie! Usually, Joey would eat cereal, fruit (a pear), or oatmeal for breakfast. After he ate, he and Jimmy went to the pond. On their way there they saw their friend Jack Rabbit. They dove into the water and swam for several hours. The sun was out, but the breeze was cold. Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home. Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them. When they got home, they dried off, and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt. Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots.

That amount hardly offset enormous cuts, beginning in 1996, by Congress to Legal Services Corp., the chief funding source for state legal-aid agencies. Threatened with extinction, LSEO clawed its way back with the help of state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way. Meanwhile, the clients keep coming. At least three-quarters are women and children living in poverty. The agency helps more than 12,000 children a year. A third of LSEO's clients are the working poor who receive no government benefits. Many are senior citizens. Riggs regrets that retired Tulsa attorney John Athens, a champion of legal aid, did not live to see how much the money has meant. Athens died last year. In his honor, The Oxley Foundation donated $200,000 to expand a client hot line. That service, which will be expanded statewide, enables needy people to consult an attorney about civil legal problems, including rent and contract disputes, domestic abuse, consumer issues and custody matters. Attorneys handle no criminal cases. R.H. Harbaugh, foundation trustee and a colleague of Athens at the Conner & Winters law firm, said his mentor had \"a special interest in people who could not afford legal services. He was aware of the hot line and supported its expansion.\" Said Riggs: \"We use lofty phrases such as 'with justice for all,' when we talk about our legal system. That phrase is etched on our U.S. Supreme Court building. Those are just empty words if people don't have access to that system.\" </Conversation Content>\nhere is the question:<question>Who made the cuts to the LSEO and how did it manage to survive?</question>\nhere is the corresponding answer:<Answer>Congress to Legal Services Corp, through service drives</Answer>",
