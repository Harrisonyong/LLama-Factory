Results similar to the popular film \"Jurassic park\" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. \"Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.\", paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.</sentence1>\n<sentence2>Paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues and other scientists discovered a T Rex bone in Montana.</sentence2>",
